# DietDroid 3000 Research Project
We are a bunch of college students interested in investigating how an AI-driven personalized diet recommendation 
system compares to traditional diet plans in terms of effectiveness, lifestyle preference, and user satisfaction 
in achieving individual dietary goals. Data is collected by asking participants to fill out carefully structured 
form regarding their dietary needs and personal preferences. Gemini-1.5-Flash API is the machine learning algorithm 
utilized to process 100+ pages of raw text data, 200+ lines of raw table data, and user input to create a detailed
personalized dietary plan. A sample of participant data is displayed, names are anonymized, two versions of AI-made
dietary plans are created: one without processed training data (plain), one with processed training data (V2). All
