Dietary Goals
Source 1. Optimal Diet Strategies for Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance - PMC.


Weight Loss, Gain, or Maintenance
* Complex Factors:
   * Weight management is influenced by various factors, with key components being the amount and type of food consumed, and meal timing.
* Low-Calorie Diet vs. Very-Low-Calorie Diet:
   * Low-Calorie Diet:
      * Involves 1,000–1,500 calories per day.
      * Typically creates a deficit of 500–750 calories per day.
      * Studies (e.g., DIETFITS) show no significant difference in weight loss between low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets.
      * Metabolic adaptations may lead to plateaus, which can be misinterpreted as “failure.”
   * Very-Low-Calorie Diet (VLCD):
      * Provides <800 kcal/day.
      * Not recommended for routine weight management; should be used with medical monitoring.
      * Recent reviews suggest VLCDs can provide greater long-term weight loss when combined with behavioral programs.
      * Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD):
         * Includes <700–800 kcal/day and <30–50 g/day of carbohydrates.
         * Recommended for severe obesity, sarcopenic obesity, T2DM, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension.
         * Contraindicated for pregnant women, those with T1DM, kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and older patients with frailty.
* Meal Replacements:
   * Includes soups, shakes, bars, and portion-controlled meals.
   * Useful for calorie control; typically not successful for long-term weight maintenance.
* Summary:
   * Energy deficit is crucial for weight loss.
   * Long-term strategies are needed due to metabolic adaptations that decrease energy expenditure.
   * VLCDs and meal replacements can be useful if traditional low-calorie diets are ineffective or for significant weight loss.
Types of Food Eaten
* Low-Fat Diet:
   * Reduces total fat intake (≤30% of calories).
   * No significant long-term weight-loss benefit over other diets.
   * Low-fat diets can reduce LDL-C but may increase triglycerides and decrease HDL-C.
   * Low in saturated fatty acids is recommended; diets supplemented with good-quality fat and fibers are healthier.
* Low-Carbohydrate Diet:
   * Defined as carbohydrate intake <50–130 g/day or 10%–45% of total energy.
   * Ketogenic Diet:
      * Extremely low in carbohydrates (<50 g/day), with a relative increase in protein and fat.
      * May have mixed effects on LDL-C; suppresses hunger and can improve T2DM, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases.
      * Contraindicated for pregnant women, those with T1DM, kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and older patients with frailty.
* High-Protein Diet:
   * Increases protein intake to 30% of total daily calories or 1–1.2 g/kg of ideal body weight per day.
   * Improves satiety, decreases fat mass, and helps preserve lean body mass.
   * May increase risk of T2DM and kidney issues; proteins from red meat are more problematic compared to fish or plant-based sources.
* Mediterranean Diet:
   * Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, poultry, fish, and dairy, with minimal red meat.
   * Evidence supports its effectiveness in weight loss, cardiovascular disease prevention, and possibly reducing cancer risk.
   * Shows strong benefits for weight loss and cardiometabolic improvements.
* Other Dietary Strategies:
   * Paleolithic Diet:
      * Emphasizes unprocessed foods, avoiding grains, dairy, processed foods, and added sugar/salt.
      * Potential favorable effects on lipid profile and blood pressure but evidence is inconclusive.
   * Low Glycemic Index/Glycemic Load Diet:
      * Focuses on exchanging high-GI foods for low-GI alternatives.
      * Benefits in managing T2DM and body weight but does not provide a complete nutritional picture.
   * Nordic Diet:
      * Based on unprocessed whole grains, high-fiber vegetables, fish, low-fat dairy, and lean meat.
      * Improves body weight significantly; however, may be difficult to maintain due to accessibility and cost.
   * Vegetarian Diet:
      * Can lower risks of ischemic heart disease, T2DM, and cancer.
      * Reduces blood pressure, lipid profiles, and inflammatory biomarkers.
      * Variants include lactovegetarians and lacto-ovo-vegetarians. May lack omega-3 fats.
   * Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet:
      * Focuses on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, and lean meats.
      * Limits sodium intake and is effective in reducing blood pressure, cancer risk, and cardiovascular risk factors.
   * Portfolio Diet:
      * A vegan diet emphasizing foods that lower cholesterol (plant sterols, nuts, soluble fibers, soy protein).
      * Effective in reducing LDL-C but has small effects on weight loss.
Timing of Meal Consumption
* Intermittent Fasting:
   * Involves periods of no or limited calorie intake.
   * Includes alternate-day fasting, 5:2 fasting, and daily time-restricted feeding.
   * Can benefit weight loss, insulin resistance, immune function, and cognitive functions.
   * Long-term effects and sustainability are still unknown.
* Meal Timing:
   * Importance of aligning eating patterns with circadian rhythms.
   * Skipping breakfast and late-night eating are associated with increased risk of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.
   * Recommendations include distributing calorie intake throughout the day and maintaining consistent overnight fasting periods.

                        Performance goals
Source 1. How do popular dietary trends impact athletic performance?


Athlete Nutrition: Key Considerations
Athletes’ dietary intake should align with the demands of exercise, recovery, training adaptations, and overall health. This requires adequate calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fats), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), fiber, and fluids to optimize performance and prevent deficiencies.
1. Caloric Needs and Macronutrients
* Caloric Deficit Risks: Athletes in a caloric deficit or those not strength training may lose muscle mass or fail to gain muscle, negatively impacting performance. Prolonged caloric deficits also increase the risk of bone health issues, including bone mineral disease.
* Protein Intake: Protein needs for athletes exceed the general recommendation of 0.8 g/kg/day. For moderate-to-high-intensity exercise, athletes should aim for 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day, with regular consumption throughout the day and post-exercise to support muscle recovery and protein synthesis.
* Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are the preferred energy source for moderate to high-intensity exercise. Endurance athletes may require up to 10–12 g/kg/day to support training and recovery.
2. Micronutrients and Hydration
* Vitamins and Minerals: Essential vitamins and minerals play critical roles in energy metabolism (B-vitamins, magnesium), bone health (calcium, vitamin D), oxygen delivery (iron, folate, B12), and inflammation reduction (antioxidants, EPA/DHA).
* Hydration: Fluid needs vary, with general daily recommendations of 2.7–3.7 L/day. Athletes need individualized fluid assessments as sweat loss ≥2% can impair performance. Thirst is not always an accurate indicator of fluid requirements during exercise.
3. Popular Diets: Benefits and Limitations
* Low-Carbohydrate Diets: Generally not recommended for athletes due to the negative impact on glycogen levels, which are critical for performance. Carbohydrate-rich foods also provide essential nutrients that support energy metabolism, bone health, and antioxidant defenses.
* Intermittent Fasting: Can disrupt nutrient timing and reduce overall calorie intake, leading to energy deficits and potential performance impairments.
* Vegan/Vegetarian Diets: These diets may lack essential amino acids and micronutrients (iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D), which are crucial for athletes. While plant-based sources exist, their lower bioavailability requires careful planning to meet nutritional needs.
* Ketogenic Diets: These diets may increase intake of red meat and saturated fats, potentially elevating LDL cholesterol levels, which may affect long-term health.
4. Dietary Adjustments for Athletes
Gradual changes in diet, supported by behavioral strategies, can lead to sustained compliance and better long-term outcomes, especially in weight management. Incremental shifts in eating habits can help athletes adapt to new diets without compromising performance.
________________


Mediterranean Diet for Athletes
The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is rich in lean proteins (fish, chicken), vegetables, fruits, olive oil, and nuts. Originally linked to reduced cardiovascular disease risk, it has gained popularity among athletes for its low inflammatory index and support for recovery and sustained performance.
1. Composition and Serving Guidelines
The MedDiet emphasizes:
* Vegetables: 2 servings per meal
* Fruits: 1–2 servings per meal
* Whole Grains: 1–2 servings per meal
* Legumes, Nuts, Fish, Poultry: Weekly servings vary (e.g., 2 servings of fish, 3–4 servings of nuts)
* Dairy, Eggs: 2 servings of dairy daily; 2–4 servings of eggs per week
* Olive Oil and Wine: Olive oil as the primary fat source and moderate wine consumption
2. Performance and Health Benefits
Research suggests that the MedDiet supports athlete performance by:
* Reducing inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein)
* Improving body composition and strength, especially in sports like CrossFit, kickboxing, and running.
* Enhancing aerobic and anaerobic performance, muscle endurance, and recovery.
* Helping athletes maintain a healthier body mass index (BMI), especially in sports requiring weight control, such as gymnastics and running.
3. Adherence and Long-Term Effects
Athletes show higher adherence to the MedDiet compared to the general population, which is linked to performance improvements without increasing the risk of burnout. Various tools, such as the Medi-Lite and MDSS, are available to assess adherence, demonstrating that maintaining this diet can be sustainable over time.
________________


Conclusion
The Mediterranean Diet is a well-balanced, nutrient-dense diet that provides the necessary support for athletes in terms of both energy and recovery. Its high adherence rates, low inflammatory profile, and benefits for body composition and performance make it an optimal choice for athletes looking for sustained energy, recovery, and overall health. By emphasizing gradual dietary changes and focusing on balanced nutrition, athletes can enhance their performance and well-being through a diet that aligns with their physical demands.

                                Health Improvement
Role of the gut microbiome in chronic diseases: a narrative review
Gut Microbiome and Autoimmune Diseases (AIDs)
The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) is influenced by genetic predispositions and environmental factors, notably gut microbiota disturbances. Emerging evidence suggests that dysbiosis (imbalanced gut microbiota) plays a key role in the immunopathogenesis of various autoimmune conditions.
________________


Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disease primarily affecting joints. Environmental factors like diet, smoking, and infections contribute to gut/oral dysbiosis and RA onset.
* Microbiome Alterations: RA patients show reduced gut microbial diversity, with increased abundance of Prevotella species (notably Prevotella copri) and Collinsella, and decreased levels of Faecalibacterium.
* Key Findings:
   * Germ-free mice: Protected from experimental arthritis, suggesting a microbiome connection.
   * Collinsella: Increases gut permeability and IL-17A expression, a cytokine involved in RA inflammation.
   * SCFAs (Short-Chain Fatty Acids): SCFAs, such as butyrate, suppress inflammation in RA. Mice deficient in SCFA receptors had exacerbated RA inflammation.
   * Zonulin: Increased gut permeability is linked to RA. Therapies targeting gut permeability (e.g., butyrate supplementation) may help delay RA onset and severity.
________________


Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)
Alterations in gut microbiota, including reduced bacterial diversity, precede metabolic symptoms of T1D.
* Microbiome Alterations: Increased Bacteroides and decreased SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) have been observed in T1D patients.
* Gut Permeability: Increased gut permeability and dysbiosis precede T1D development, with gut permeability modulation potentially influencing disease incidence.
* SCFAs and T1D:
   * Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice: High SCFA diets (acetate and butyrate) protected against T1D through immune-modulating effects.
   * SCFAs play a role in reducing gut inflammation and improving immune function, potentially delaying or preventing T1D.
________________


Atopic Eczema
Atopic eczema is a chronic skin condition with immune dysregulation, gut microbiota imbalance, and skin barrier dysfunction.
* Microbiome Alterations: Increased Clostridia, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus and decreased Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides have been linked to eczema. SCFA producers, like Coprococcus eutactus, are lower in patients with severe eczema.
* SCFAs: Reduced levels of butyrate and propionate are associated with severe eczema, likely due to a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria (F. prausnitzii).
* Microbial Function: Dysbiosis affects the immune system and gut-barrier integrity, potentially driving eczema progression.
________________


Atopic Asthma
The rapid rise in asthma prevalence, especially in industrialized nations, is linked to altered gut microbiota in early life.
* Microbiome Alterations: Proteobacteria (e.g., Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria) dominate in asthma patients. Dysbiosis early in life, influenced by factors like antibiotic use and cesarean birth, has been linked to asthma.
* SCFAs and Asthma: SCFAs have protective effects against asthma by reducing airway inflammation and immune cell activity. High levels of butyrate and propionate in infants reduce asthma risk.
* Histamine-Producing Bacteria: Increased histamine-secreting bacteria in asthma patients correlate with disease severity, suggesting microbiota’s role in modulating immune responses in asthma.

Gut Inflammation and Bowel Disorders
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
IBS involves abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, with gut microbial dysbiosis contributing to low-grade inflammation.
* Microbiome Alterations: Increased Firmicutes (e.g., Ruminococcus, Clostridium) and reduced Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium have been observed in IBS patients.
* SCFAs and IBS: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii plays a key role in maintaining gut health, and its reduction is associated with worsened IBS symptoms. SCFAs, particularly butyrate, improve gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation.
* Dietary Management: A low-FODMAP diet has shown efficacy in reducing IBS symptoms by modulating gut microbiota composition, though not all patients respond equally.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
IBD encompasses Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), both characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation.
* Microbiome Alterations: Decreased microbial diversity, specifically lower levels of butyrate-producing Firmicutes (e.g., Faecalibacterium and Roseburia) and increased Proteobacteria, are common in IBD patients.
* SCFAs and IBD: Butyrate supports colon health by enhancing epithelial barrier integrity and reducing inflammation. Therapies aiming to restore butyrate levels, such as probiotics, may help in managing IBD.
Gut Microbiome and Cardiometabolic Diseases
1. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
* Gut Microbiota and CVD: Changes in gut microbiota composition and function are linked to CVD development. Mechanistic studies in rats have shown associations with myocardial infarction severity.
* Hypertension:
   * Human Studies:
      * In the TwinsUK cohort, self-reported hypertension showed no relation to 68 microbiota markers.
      * The CARDIA study observed that increased gut microbiome diversity was modestly associated with reduced systolic blood pressure.
      * The FINRISK study found weak overall associations between gut microbiota composition and blood pressure but noted changes in microbiota genera related to hypertension.
      * Specifically, Lactobacillus paracasei was linked to lower mean arterial pressure and reduced dietary sodium intake.
* Diet and Gut Microbiota:
   * Western Diet: High in choline and carnitine, can increase cardiovascular risk through trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) production.
   * Mediterranean Diet: Associated with reduced blood pressure and body-mass index, particularly when combined with fasting.
* Probiotics:
   * Rodent Studies: Probiotics like Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus improved heart function after myocardial infarction.
   * Meta-Analysis: Probiotic use resulted in significant blood pressure reduction.
   * Atherosclerosis: A. muciniphila supplementation protected against atherosclerosis in a Western diet model.
2. Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)
* Gut Microbiota in T2DM: Patients with T2DM often have altered gut microbiota. Key findings include:
   * Negative Associations: Genera such as Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia.
   * Positive Associations: Genera like Ruminococcus and Fusobacterium.
* Microbial Metabolites:
   * Butyrate: Linked to insulin sensitivity. SCFAs like butyrate trigger GLP-1 secretion, impacting insulin release and appetite.
   * Microbiome-Metabolite Score: Strongly associated with T2DM prevalence and incidence, suggesting these metabolites as key links between microbiome composition and health.
3. Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
* Gut-Liver Axis: Dysbiosis can increase intestinal permeability, leading to endotoxemia and liver damage.
* Microbiota Changes:
   * Alterations: Decreased alpha and beta diversity, increased Proteobacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae, and reduced butyrate producers.
   * Advanced NAFLD/NASH: Decreased levels of F. prausnitzii and variable SCFA levels (e.g., acetate higher in advanced stages).
* Mechanisms: Microbial species can metabolize bile acids or produce toxins that affect liver health. SCFAs have dual roles, potentially promoting or preventing NAFLD depending on their signaling pathways.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
* Gut-Kidney Axis: Gut dysbiosis in CKD involves reduced microbial diversity and increased levels of harmful bacteria.
* Microbiota Changes:
   * Decreased: Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillaceae, Akkermansia, and Prevotellaceae.
   * Increased: Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococci, and Clostridium perfringes.
* SCFAs: Decreased in CKD, which contributes to disease progression. Increased proteolytic bacteria lead to harmful uremic toxins.
* Therapeutic Interventions:
   * Prebiotics, Probiotics, and Synbiotics: Shown to potentially improve gut microbiota, reduce inflammation, and modulate uremic toxins in CKD patients.
Effects of a Healthy Diet Mediated by the Gut Microbiome
1. Diet and Gut Microbiome Interaction
* Dietary Interventions: Clinical studies have shown that dietary changes can impact gut microbiota. For example:
   * Fiber-Rich Diets: Improve glucose control and metabolic profiles in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients and reduce coronary heart disease risk.
   * Individual Variation: Postprandial glycemic responses vary among individuals eating the same meals. Considering gut microbiota composition can help design personalized diets for better glucose control.
2. Microbiome Structure and Cardiometabolic Markers
* Study Findings:
   * Microbial Diversity: Correlated with fasting and postprandial biomarkers. Notably, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) was positively linked with microbial species richness.
   * Predictive Value: Gut microbiome composition was a better predictor of postprandial triglycerides and insulin levels than glucose.
   * Diet Influence: Healthy plant-based diets shape gut microbiome composition. Approximately 10% of microbiome composition variance was explained by eating patterns.
3. Diet-Specific Microbial Changes
* Bacterial Taxa:
   * Healthy vs. Unhealthy Diets: Bacterial species were grouped by their association with plant-based (DietPositive) or animal-based (DietNegative) foods.
   * Mediterranean Diet: A 12-month study found significant changes in gut microbiota.
      * DietPositive Bacteria: Associated with lower inflammation markers and better health indicators.
      * DietNegative Bacteria: Linked to higher inflammation and frailty.
   * Overlap with Other Studies: Findings were consistent with studies on omega-3 fatty acids and soluble fiber (inulin) supplementation.
4. Effect of Dietary Fat and Carbohydrates
* Type of Dietary Fat:
   * Saturated Fat: Increased Proteobacteria abundance.
   * Unsaturated Fat: Increased butyrate-producing bacteria.
* Carbohydrate Sources:
   * Resistant Starch Types: Different forms of resistant starch (maize, potato, tapioca) impacted gut microbiome composition and SCFA production in specific ways.
      * Maize Starch: Increased butyrate producers.
      * Tapioca Starch: Shifted propionate proportions, increasing succinate-producing bacteria.
   * Dose Dependency: The effects were dose-dependent, plateauing at 35 g/day.
5. Conclusions and Implications
* Dietary Impact: Specific dietary interventions can target and modulate gut microbiome composition, influencing metabolic health and disease outcomes.
* Personalized Diets: Understanding individual responses to diet and gut microbiome interactions can lead to more effective, personalized dietary recommendations.

**WHO Updates Guidelines on Fats and Carbohydrates (July 2023)**  
[WHO News: Updated Guidelines on Fats and Carbohydrates](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-07-2023-who-updates-guidelines-on-fats-and-carbohydrates)


### Key Takeaways:


1. **Saturated Fats**  
   - **Recommendation**: Limit saturated fats to less than 10% of total daily energy intake.  
   - **Reason**: High intake of saturated fats can raise cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.


2. **Trans Fats**  
   - **Recommendation**: Eliminate trans fats entirely from the diet.  
   - **Reason**: Industrial trans fats (found in processed foods) significantly raise the risk of heart disease and offer no known health benefits.


3. **Polyunsaturated and Monounsaturated Fats**  
   - **Recommendation**: Replace saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats, particularly polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fats (MUFAs).  
   - **Sources**: Nuts, seeds, fish, and plant oils (e.g., olive, sunflower, and soybean oils).  
   - **Health Benefits**: Help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.


4. **Carbohydrate Intake**  
   - **Recommendation**: A balance between quality and quantity of carbohydrate intake. Carbohydrates should make up 50-60% of daily energy intake, but the emphasis should be on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.  
   - **Reason**: Refined carbohydrates, such as sugar and white flour, can contribute to weight gain and increased risk of diabetes and heart disease.


5. **Free Sugars**  
   - **Recommendation**: Reduce the intake of free sugars (added sugars) to less than 10% of total energy intake, and ideally, less than 5% for additional health benefits.  
   - **Reason**: High consumption of added sugars contributes to obesity, dental cavities, and chronic diseases like diabetes.


6. **Fiber**  
   - **Recommendation**: Increase dietary fiber intake through consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.  
   - **Reason**: High-fiber diets are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.


7. **General Healthy Eating Guidelines**  
   - **Emphasis**: Promote balanced diets rich in plant-based foods, limit consumption of processed foods high in trans fats and sugars, and focus on overall nutritional quality rather than simply macronutrient composition.  
   - **Global Context**: These guidelines apply to all populations, but specific recommendations may vary based on local dietary habits and health priorities.


By implementing these updated guidelines, WHO aims to help individuals and communities reduce the risk of chronic diseases and promote healthier, balanced diets globally.
                        




Dietary preferences/ restrictions

Factors that predict weight loss success differ by diet intervention type
1. Introduction
Overweight and obesity are global public health concerns, affecting around 2 billion adults and nearly 400 million children and adolescents worldwide (1). A market survey conducted with 22,008 individuals from 30 countries revealed that 45–60% of people are actively trying to lose weight (2). These numbers highlight the critical need to identify key determinants for successful weight loss strategies (3). Although a variety of diets can achieve weight loss by creating a negative energy balance, a successful diet is defined as one that results in a loss of at least 5% of baseline body weight while also improving cardiometabolic health (4).
Common weight loss strategies include manipulating macronutrient composition (e.g., low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets) and reducing total energy intake (low-calorie diets). Low-carbohydrate diets are promoted based on the idea that they increase satiety and stimulate fat burning through the carbohydrate-insulin model (5). Conversely, low-fat diets aim to prevent weight gain and reduce cardiovascular disease risk (6), while low-calorie diets focus on creating a calorie deficit. However, adaptive thermogenesis can make weight loss challenging and increase the likelihood of regaining lost weight (7).
Research indicates that various diet types can lead to weight loss with similar outcomes. A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found that low-carbohydrate diets resulted in slightly greater weight loss than low-fat diets at six months, but this difference was no longer significant at 12 months (8). A larger meta-analysis of 121 randomized controlled trials found minimal differences in weight loss between low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets at six months, with no significant differences at 12 months (9). Thus, any diet adhered to over time can result in weight loss (10).
Despite the effectiveness of various diets, weight loss responses can vary significantly among individuals, even within the same dietary intervention. For instance, a 12-month trial of four popular diets showed weight changes ranging from a loss of 30 kg to a gain of 10 kg within each group (11). These variations suggest that individual biological, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors influence diet efficacy. The current study aims to identify factors that impact weight loss success across diets with varying macronutrient and caloric compositions, providing insight into personalizing dietary approaches for better outcomes.
2. Methods
2.1. Recruitment and Eligibility
Participants were recruited for dietary weight loss interventions conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between 2016 and 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1). Recruitment strategies included flyers posted in various locations and email announcements via the VUMC research listserv. Eligible participants were aged 21–60 years, with a BMI of 30.0 to 49.9 kg/m² and weight stability in the three months prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of various diseases (e.g., diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease), recent surgeries, food allergies, alcohol abuse, smoking, and pregnancy. Participants gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the VUMC Institutional Review Board.
2.2. Diet Interventions
Participants self-selected one of three diet interventions lasting 4–6 months. Each diet was designed with specific macronutrient goals:
* Low carbohydrate (LOW CHO): 30% carbohydrate, 50% fat, 20% protein
* Low fat (LOW FAT): 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 20% protein
* Low calorie (LOW KCAL): A calorie reduction of 500 kcal/day from baseline intake, with a macronutrient distribution identical to LOW FAT
Resting energy expenditure was measured via metabolic cart to tailor calorie goals for weight loss.
2.3. Diet Assessment
Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour diet recall interviews following the validated U.S. Department of Agriculture five-step multi-pass methodology. The Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R) software was used to analyze energy intake, macronutrient composition, and micronutrient levels. Food intake was categorized into 12 subgroups for analysis, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins (Supplementary Table S1).
2.4. Anthropometry, Body Composition, and Resting Energy Expenditure
Body measurements, including height, weight, waist/hip circumference, and body composition, were taken at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured using a metabolic cart, and body composition was assessed via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
2.5. Clinical Biomarkers
Blood and urine samples were collected to assess biomarkers, including glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Plasma leptin levels were measured, and HOMA-IR was calculated to assess insulin resistance.
2.6. Questionnaires
Participants completed several questionnaires, including the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) to assess eating disorder risk and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale to evaluate depression. Physical activity levels were assessed using the Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment Questionnaire (PACT-Q).
2.7. Statistical Analysis
Baseline differences between diet groups were analyzed using chi-square or ANOVA. Age, sex, and BMI were included as covariates. Multivariate regression models were developed to assess the impact of various factors on weight loss, with predictors removed via forward-backward stepwise regression. Logistic regression was used to assess weight loss success (≥5% baseline weight) and intervention completion. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
3. Results
Among 305 participants, 65% were white and 35% identified as Black or other. The LOW CHO group was 100% female, while the LOW KCAL group had older participants with higher glucose and insulin levels. A total of 48% of participants met the criteria for Class I obesity (BMI 30.0–34.9), 42% for Class II obesity (BMI 35.0–39.9), and 10% for Class III obesity (BMI ≥40.0).
4. Discussion
The current study adds to the body of evidence indicating that no single diet is superior for weight loss. Meta-analyses have shown that diet composition (e.g., low carbohydrate vs low fat) does not significantly impact energy expenditure or weight loss over time (24). Individuals can choose a diet based on personal preferences without compromising weight loss outcomes. However, specific factors, such as demographic characteristics, body composition, and clinical biomarkers, can influence weight loss success across different diet types.
4.1 Demographic Predictors
Age, race, and education level were significant predictors of weight loss success. Older individuals and those with higher education levels tended to lose more weight, possibly due to greater available time, resources, and social support. Racial differences in weight loss were observed, particularly for African-American women, which may be due to a combination of genetic, cultural, and environmental factors.
4.2 Biological Predictors
Baseline body fat percentage and serum leptin levels were significant predictors of weight loss in the LOW CHO and LOW FAT groups. Leptin resistance, often associated with higher body fat, may hinder weight loss. Higher LDL cholesterol and blood pressure were also associated with weight loss, particularly in the LOW FAT and LOW KCAL groups, likely because participants with cardiometabolic concerns were more motivated to lose weight.
4.3 Intervention Completion
The most significant predictor of weight loss success was intervention completion, accounting for 20–30% of the variance in outcomes. Weight loss progress itself was the strongest motivator for participants to complete the intervention. Older participants had higher adherence rates, while younger adults, who face more lifestyle challenges, had higher dropout rates.
4.4 Cardiometabolic Improvements
Weight loss success (≥5% of baseline weight) was associated with improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors across all three diet types, including reductions in blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and C-reactive protein. These findings support the idea that even modest weight loss can lead to significant health benefits.
5. Conclusion
The study underscores the importance of intervention completion for successful weight loss. While no single diet type is superior, aligning dietary interventions with an individual’s specific cardiometabolic risk profile may yield the most significant health improvements. Future research should investigate long-term maintenance strategies and the role of exercise in enhancing weight loss outcomes.
Source 2. Diet Adherence among Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Concept Analysis - PMC


Introduction
In recent decades, global changes in nutritional patterns and increased sedentary behavior have contributed to a worldwide epidemic termed ‘diabesity,’ a condition in which obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) coexist. This issue is particularly relevant in Oman, where T2DM cases are increasing by approximately 7000 per year, bringing the total number to around 98,000 cases. For adults with T2DM, adherence to self-care routines—including dietary restrictions, physical exercise, medication, and glucose monitoring—is critical for achieving sustained glycemic control and favorable long-term health outcomes.
Dietary adherence is especially challenging for patients with T2DM. Unlike medication adherence, which involves fewer and more straightforward actions, dietary changes require consistent effort throughout the day. Furthermore, three specific challenges complicate diet adherence in T2DM patients:
1. Customized diets based on individual patient characteristics.
2. Conflicting dietary recommendations from various health authorities.
3. Evolving nutritional science, which may cause confusion and reduce patients’ resolve to adhere to dietary plans.
Only about 25% of T2DM patients adhere to their prescribed dietary plans, highlighting the importance of developing effective strategies for improving adherence. This literature review aims to define diet adherence for healthcare providers and identify key barriers to diet adherence in T2DM patients.
________________


Definitions and Conceptual Background
In healthcare literature, the terms "adherence," "compliance," "concordance," and "sustenance" are often used interchangeably. The term "adherence" gained popularity in the mid-1990s, replacing the term "compliance," as it is perceived as less judgmental and more reflective of a mutual responsibility between the patient and healthcare provider. Adherence is frequently used in combination with other terms, such as "medication adherence," "exercise adherence," and "diet adherence."
Adherence to a diabetic diet, the cornerstone of T2DM management, involves individualized dietary recommendations given within a medical context. A healthy diet typically includes at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, with limited intake of free sugars and fats. Despite its proven benefits, dietary adherence remains low among T2DM patients. For example, in the US, only 28% of people with diabetes meet the recommended guidelines for saturated fat, and adherence rates are similarly low in other regions, such as Jordan and New Zealand.
________________


Methods
The Walker and Avant method of concept analysis was employed to clarify the meaning of diet adherence, its attributes, antecedents, and consequences. The analysis involved a comprehensive literature search of English-language studies published between 2010 and 2020. Scientific databases, such as CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and others, were searched using keywords including "diet adherence," "compliance," and "T2DM." The search yielded a range of studies, which were evaluated for inclusion based on their focus on defining attributes, antecedents, consequences, and measurement of diet adherence.
________________


Results
Definition of Diet Adherence
Adherence, according to the Cambridge English Dictionary, is the act of following rules or guidelines strictly. When combined with "diet," it refers to faithfully following dietary recommendations, usually agreed upon by both the patient and healthcare provider. In T2DM patients, these dietary recommendations must be tailored to the individual, taking into account their disease stage, biochemical parameters, and available food options.
The World Health Organization defines adherence as the degree to which a person's behavior, including dietary habits, aligns with healthcare recommendations. Self-efficacy and family support are crucial for maintaining dietary adherence, with social and economic factors playing a significant role.
________________


Key Attributes of Diet Adherence
Three critical attributes of diet adherence were identified:
1. Following Recommendations: The first step in dietary adherence is understanding and implementing dietary recommendations. This involves changing negative thoughts into positive internal dialogues and learning new skills to adopt healthier behaviors.
2. Self-Monitoring: Self-monitoring involves awareness and recording of dietary intake, which can include calories, macronutrients, or portion sizes. This process helps patients improve their self-management and has been linked to successful weight loss.
3. Maintenance and Relapse Prevention: Maintaining dietary changes over the long term is essential but challenging. Factors such as stress or social events may lead to relapses. Strategies for relapse prevention are necessary to help patients sustain dietary adherence.
________________


Antecedents of Diet Adherence
Several antecedents must precede the behavior change required for successful diet adherence:
* Motivation: Motivation is critical in initiating and maintaining adherence. It mobilizes personal resources and is closely linked to improved clinical outcomes, such as lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.
* Understanding Recommendations: Patients must fully understand dietary recommendations to adhere to them. Studies have shown that a better understanding leads to higher adherence.
* Self-Efficacy: The belief in one's ability to follow a prescribed diet is a significant predictor of long-term success.
* Goal Setting: Setting specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) goals can help improve dietary adherence.
* Social Support: Family and social support play a crucial role in helping individuals maintain dietary changes, particularly when it comes to meal planning and grocery shopping.
________________


Consequences of Diet Adherence
Adhering to a prescribed diet offers numerous benefits, including:
* Clinical Improvements: Better control of body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
* Psychological Benefits: Increased self-esteem, confidence, and overall health-related quality of life.
________________


Conclusion
This concept analysis clarified the definition of diet adherence in T2DM patients, highlighting the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of adherence. Understanding these components can help healthcare providers develop better strategies and interventions to support patients in adhering to their dietary plans.

Personalized Nutrition
Personalized Nutrition: An Emerging Approach
Recent research suggests that people react to foods and nutrients differently based on genetics and other factors, such as their gut microbiome. Traditional dietary guidelines, like the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, are aimed at public health, but nutrition science is moving toward individualized approaches.
"Personalized nutrition provides targeted nutritional advice based on specific information about an individual," says Jos Ordovás, PhD, director of the Nutrition and Genomics Laboratory. Advances in science are making it more likely that a particular diet will work for a specific person.
Factors Influencing Dietary Choices
There are several variables that shape dietary decisions:
1. Personal Preferences: Everyone has different tastes.
2. Life Stage and Health Goals: Nutritional needs change based on age, health status, and objectives, such as weight loss or blood sugar control.
3. Health Conditions: People with allergies or intolerances have different dietary needs.
4. Socio-Economic Factors: Economic and environmental factors play a role in food choices.
5. Nutrient Absorption: As people age, their ability to absorb nutrients like vitamin B12 or produce vitamin D decreases.
"A healthy dietary pattern should provide all necessary nutrients without exceeding calorie needs," says Alice H. Lichtenstein, DSc, director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory. This pattern can be customized to account for individual preferences, life stages, and health needs.
Genetic Influence on Nutrition
Genes impact how our bodies absorb, transport, and metabolize nutrients. "Two people can follow the same diet but experience different outcomes," explains Ordovás. Some people may lose more weight than others on the same diet due to genetic variations. For instance, a specific gene variant can increase the link between saturated fat intake and obesity, so people with this variant may benefit more from reducing saturated fat in their diet.
Role of the Gut Microbiome
Trillions of microbes live in the human gut, influencing how food is processed. "In the future, we may be able to recommend specific diets based on a person's microbiota fingerprint to reduce disease risk," says Ordovás. Changing the diet could also potentially alter the microbiome to improve health outcomes.
Behavior and Personalized Nutrition
Even with personalized data, behavior change is key to success. "Personalized nutrition might motivate people to adopt healthier habits," says Ordovás. A study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology showed that personalized dietary advice led to healthier lifestyle changes compared to conventional advice. However, the study found no additional benefit when genetic testing was included.
Behavioral traits, such as emotional eating, may also be factored into personalized nutrition. This could provide more effective approaches to overcoming dietary challenges.
Challenges and Promises of Personalized Nutrition
The field of personalized nutrition is still developing. Some early companies overpromised results, but the science is improving. "We are still far from fully understanding how individual biology interacts with food," says Ordovás. At this point, expensive genetic tests may not be necessary for most people.
Future research will need to study individuals with specific genetic traits to determine whether personalized diets are more effective than standard dietary advice. Even if we reach that level of precision, challenges remain, such as integrating different dietary needs within a family or addressing the high cost of personalized testing and meals.
Despite these hurdles, personalized nutrition holds promise for refining healthy eating patterns. "You don’t need a genetic test to tell you to eat more fruits and vegetables," says Ordovás, "but personalized guidance might help you make more effective changes."
Conclusion
Personalized nutrition offers the potential for better dietary outcomes by considering individual genetic and microbiome factors. However, success still relies on behavior change, and current tools may not be necessary for everyone. Personalized nutrition may motivate healthier habits, but the hard work of changing behaviors remains essential for achieving long-term health benefits.

   * Study Design: Data from two cohort studies (MoBa in Norway and ALSPAC in the UK) were used. Participants completed FFQs to report dietary patterns during pregnancy.
   * Population: MoBa involved 84,548 pregnancies, and ALSPAC involved 11,760 pregnancies. Both cohorts tracked autism diagnoses and autism-associated traits (like social communication difficulties) up to age 8.
   * Dietary Pattern: A healthy prenatal diet was defined through factor analysis and included high consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and whole grains, and low consumption of red/processed meat and sugary foods.
   * Outcome Measures:
   * Autism Diagnosis: Collected from hospital records and diagnostic criteria (ICD-10 codes) in MoBa.
   * Social Communication Difficulties: Measured using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) in MoBa and the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (SCDC) in ALSPAC.
________________


Statistical Analysis
   * Confounders: Maternal age, education, depression, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, multivitamin use, and planned pregnancy were considered.
   * Models: Odds ratios were calculated for each outcome (autism diagnosis, SCQ, SCDC) by comparing high, medium, and low adherence to a healthy diet. Sensitivity analyses tested robustness by adjusting for additional factors.
________________


Results
   * Main Findings:
   * High adherence to a healthy prenatal diet was associated with lower odds of:
   * Autism diagnosis in MoBa (OR 0.78).
   * Social communication difficulties in MoBa and ALSPAC (OR 0.74).
   * No consistent association with restrictive/repetitive behaviors.
   * Sensitivity Analysis:
   * A plant-based diet was linked to fewer social communication difficulties.
   * A fish-based diet was associated with fewer restrictive behaviors.
________________


Discussion and Conclusion
   * Key Insights:
   * A healthy prenatal diet may reduce the odds of autism diagnosis and social communication difficulties, especially in female offspring.
   * Limitations:
   * Inconsistent results for some autism traits.
   * Study relied on self-reported dietary information.
   * Conclusion: This study supports the idea that prenatal diet can influence autism-related outcomes, though more research is needed.
________________


Supplemental Information
   * Data Sources: MoBa and ALSPAC provided a comprehensive data set for this study.
   * Ethical Considerations: Both studies were approved by respective ethics committees, and participants provided informed consent.

Objective
To describe the meal patterns of young adults and determine if the frequency of family meals during adolescence is associated with diet quality, meal frequency, social eating, and meal structure in young adulthood.
________________


Study Design
A population-based, 5-year longitudinal study in Minnesota.
________________


Subjects and Setting
   * Participants: 946 female and 764 male high school students (Time 1: 1998-1999, mean age 15.9 years)
   * Follow-up: By mail (Time 2: 2003-2004, mean age 20.4 years)
________________


Statistical Analysis
   * Method: Multiple linear regression models were used to predict young adult outcomes based on adolescent family meal frequency.
   * Trend Testing: Linear contrasts were used to test probability trends across family meal frequency categories.
________________


Results
   * Dietary Outcomes:
   * Family meal frequency during adolescence was associated with:
   * Higher intake of fruits (P<0.05), vegetables (P<0.01), dark-green and orange vegetables (P=0.001), and key nutrients.
   * Lower intake of soft drinks (P<0.05) in young adulthood.
   * Meal Frequency:
   * Higher frequency of breakfast in females (P<0.01).
   * More frequent dinners (P<0.05) in both sexes.
   * Social Eating and Meal Structure:
   * Higher priority for meal structure (P<0.001) and social eating (P<0.001) in both sexes.
   * Longitudinal Effects:
   * Associations between Time 1 family meals and Time 2 dietary outcomes remained significant even after adjusting for Time 1 outcomes, although some effects were attenuated.
________________


Conclusions
Family meal frequency during adolescence may have a long-lasting, positive influence on diet quality and meal patterns during young adulthood.
________________


Background
Previous cross-sectional studies have shown that family meals are associated with better nutritional intake and healthier eating patterns in adolescents, including higher fruit, vegetable, and nutrient intakes and lower soft drink and saturated fat consumption. However, little research has examined the long-term benefits of family meals into young adulthood, where nutrition continues to play a critical role in supporting growth, maintaining health, and preventing chronic diseases. National data indicate common nutrition problems among young adults, including excess energy consumption and insufficient intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and key nutrients.
Young adulthood, marked by lifestyle changes such as moving out of the family home, starting work or postsecondary studies, and possibly beginning one's own family, may influence meal patterns. Studies suggest a decline in breakfast frequency and social eating with increasing independence. Therefore, this study investigates if family meal frequency during adolescence is associated with better diet quality, structured eating habits, and social eating during the transition to young adulthood.
________________


Methods
   * Data Source:
   * The study used data from Project EAT (Eating Among Teens)-II, a longitudinal study that examined socio-environmental and behavioral determinants of dietary intake and weight status.
   * Participants: 1,710 young adults (45% male), mean age 20.4 years.

Religious Dietary Rules and Potential Nutritional and Health Consequences: Structured Overview
Introduction:
   * 84% of the global population identifies with a religious group.
   * Many religions have specific dietary rules intended to promote physical and spiritual well-being.
   * Understanding these dietary practices is essential for health professionals to respect and meet the needs of religiously diverse populations, particularly in countries with high migration rates.
   * This study aims to explore how religious dietary rules might impact nutrition and health, offering insights for healthcare professionals to address potential nutritional inadequacies without judgment.
Methods:
   * A literature review was conducted using databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline.
   * Sources included holy texts, religious organizations, and scientific publications.
   * The analysis focused on the Abrahamic and Asian religions, excluding less prevalent religions with insufficient nutritional studies.
   * Reviewed dietary rules and breastfeeding practices of major religions and analyzed potential health outcomes, including deficiencies and benefits.
   * The review evaluated large cohort studies, case-control studies, meta-analyses, and surveys with significant sample sizes.
Findings by Religion:
   * Christianity:
   * Dietary practices vary across denominations. Some promote fasting and abstinence, while others, like Seventh-day Adventists, encourage vegetarianism.
   * Nutritional impact: Balanced vegetarian diets can prevent deficiencies, but prolonged fasting may lead to malnutrition.
   * Judaism:
   * Adheres to strict dietary rules (Kosher) involving the exclusion of certain animals, specific slaughter methods, and meat preparation rituals.
   * Nutritional impact: Potential risks include iron deficiency due to exsanguination in slaughtering practices and increased salt intake. Observant groups, especially Orthodox Jews, may experience higher rates of anemia.
   * Islam:
   * Follows Halal dietary laws and practices fasting during Ramadan.
   * Nutritional impact: Potential risks include dehydration during fasting, weight fluctuations, and complications for individuals with diabetes.
   * Hinduism:
   * Most Hindus follow a lacto-vegetarian diet, with abstinence from alcohol and certain meats.
   * Nutritional impact: Risk of iron and vitamin B12 deficiency in poorly balanced vegetarian diets.
   * Buddhism:
   * Promotes vegetarianism, but dietary rules are less formal.
   * Nutritional impact: Balanced vegetarian diets are beneficial, but deficiencies may arise in iron and B12.
Discussion:
   * The review identifies both potential benefits (e.g., lower risk of alcohol-related diseases, cardiovascular benefits from vegetarianism) and risks (e.g., nutritional deficiencies, dehydration from fasting).
   * Health professionals must consider the implications of religious dietary rules when providing dietary advice to individuals, especially in relation to iron, vitamin B12, and overall caloric intake.
Conclusion:
   * Religious dietary rules are diverse and complex, with varied nutritional and health impacts.
   * Healthcare providers should have an understanding of these practices to offer tailored nutritional advice that respects religious beliefs while preventing deficiencies or health risks.
Recommendations for Healthcare Professionals:
   1. Educate religious individuals about potential nutritional risks related to their dietary practices.
   2. Encourage balanced meals that meet nutritional needs within the framework of religious rules.
   3. Monitor and address risks of dehydration, anemia, and deficiencies, particularly during periods of fasting.
Kosher Laws (Judaism)
   * Milk from kosher animals is also kosher, but cheese made using non-kosher animal rennet is not.
   * Meat (except fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and grains) cannot be consumed, cooked, or processed with dairy (Ex. 23:19, Ex. 34:26, Deut. 14:21).
   * After eating meat, one must wait 3–6 hours before consuming dairy, but only rinse the mouth and eat a neutral solid when switching from dairy to meat.
   * Separate utensils, plates, and dishwashers are required for meat and dairy in orthodox homes, leading some families to avoid either meat or dairy.
   * Eliminating meat can cause iron deficiency in children (high prevalence of ID in Israeli children), while avoiding dairy can reduce calcium intake, though rare in Israel.
   * A study in The Netherlands linked Jewish food laws with shorter stature in 19th-century male conscripts.
   * Another study found a U-shaped relationship between religiosity and health among Israeli Jews, with moderately religious individuals experiencing worse health than both secular and highly observant groups.
Yom Kippur (Judaism)
   * Yom Kippur is a day of fasting for all adults (Lev: 16, 23, Num. 29) from sundown to sundown.
   * Pregnant and lactating women, children under 9, and sick individuals are exempt from fasting.
   * Healthy individuals generally tolerate fasting, though there is mild dehydration risk in hot climates.
Christian Dietary Practices
   * Catholicism:
   * Abstinence from meat is observed on Fridays (especially during Lent) and fasting on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday for adults under 60.
   * Fish and vegetarian dishes are common on abstinence days.
   * Protestantism:
   * Most Protestants have no strict food laws, but Seventh-day Adventists follow a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, leading to lower obesity, cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease rates.
   * Some Adventists eat only two meals a day, with long overnight fasts aiding in weight loss and glucose control.
   * Orthodox Christianity:
   * Orthodox Christians observe 180–200 days of abstinence, abstaining from meat, dairy, fish, and olive oil during Lent.
   * Fasting results in lower body mass, cholesterol, and cardiovascular risk factors.
   * In Ethiopia, Orthodox Christians observe over 200 fasting days per year, and this practice can lead to underweight and growth deficits in mothers and children.
Islamic Dietary Practices
   * Tahneek: Prelacteal feeding of newborns with softened dates or honey (possible botulism risk).
   * Breastfeeding is strongly encouraged, and mothers should breastfeed for two lunar years (Sura 2:233).
   * Complementary foods are sometimes delayed, leading to iron and vitamin D deficiencies.
   * Milk banking is controversial due to concerns over "milk siblings."
   * Halal Laws:
   * Halal laws allow all vegetarian foods and kosher meat but prohibit pork, alcohol, and blood.
   * Islamic slaughtering methods can result in lower iron content in meats.
   * Studies suggest religious observance may reduce meat consumption.
   * Vitamin D Deficiency:
   * Veiled women are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency due to less sun exposure (as observed in studies from Turkey, China, and Saudi Arabia).
   * Ramadan:
   * Fasting during Ramadan involves abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours.
   * Weight loss is typically minor, but overeating during iftar can cause digestive issues.
   * Dehydration and other risks are possible, especially for individuals with medical conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, though guidelines for managing these conditions exist.
   * Despite exemptions, many pregnant or ill individuals choose to fast, sometimes affecting health outcomes.
Asian Religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism)
   * Hinduism:
   * This ancient religion includes various philosophies and practices, but detailed dietary specifics are not provided here.
1. Breastfeeding Practices
   * India:
   * 90-95% of mothers breastfeed regardless of education, caste, place of birth/residence.
   * Decline in exclusive breastfeeding: 74% at 1 month, 46% by 4 months.
   * Median exclusive breastfeeding: 1.4 months; breastfeeding + water: 4.7 months.
   * Hindu mothers often discard colostrum, feeding newborns cow's milk, water, or honey due to cultural beliefs.
   * Buddhism:
   * Strong breastfeeding culture, continuing beyond 2 years.
   * Chinese culture:
   * Breastfeeding is encouraged. Survey data:
   * 58% of infants aged 6-8 months receive breast milk.
   * Formula also used by 46% of infants.
2. Dietary Habits by Religion and Region
   * Hinduism:
   * Many Hindus avoid meat, fish, and eggs due to the belief in the sanctity of living beings.
   * Lacto-vegetarianism is common; milk products are encouraged.
   * Sacred cows are never consumed.
   * Risks of deficiencies: vitamin B12, iron, zinc, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids.
   * Surveys show higher undernutrition and iron deficiency anemia (ID) in Hindus compared to other religious groups (24% vs. 11-21% undernutrition).
   * Sikhism:
   * Sikhs are generally free to choose meat or vegetarian diets but must avoid halal/kosher meat.
   * Many follow a lacto-vegetarian diet, with strict avoidance of alcohol.
   * Buddhism:
   * Many Buddhists follow lacto-vegetarian diets under the principle of non-harm.
   * Monks/nuns avoid eating after noon.
   * Studies show varying effects of vegetarianism on body composition and bone health, depending on the duration and type of vegetarianism.
   * Chinese culture:
   * Traditional Chinese diets are rich in starch, legumes, and vegetables, with moderate meat, poultry, and seafood consumption.
   * Changing dietary patterns towards high-fat, low-carb diets have led to nutrient deficiencies in calcium, iron, and other essential vitamins/minerals.
3. Nutritional Risks and Observations
   * Hinduism:
   * Strict vegetarians are more prone to ID anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in pregnant women and infants.
   * Risks increase with the exclusion of animal products and milk.
   * Buddhism:
   * Long-term vegetarianism has shown risks for postmenopausal women regarding bone health, especially in vegan diets.
   * However, not all studies agree on the impact of vegetarian diets on bone mineral density.
   * Chinese Culture:
   * The traditional diet has benefits but is shifting, with children often having inadequate calcium and vitamin intake.
   * Rice is a staple, but half of Chinese infants consume no fruits or vegetables, leading to deficiencies.
4. Cultural/Religious Fasting and Nutritional Impact
   * Religious fasting:
   * Fasting practices vary widely:
   * Greek Orthodox: periods of abstinence, similar to vegetarian diets.
   * Islam (Ramadan): Moderate or reversible impact on nutrition.
   * Prolonged fasting in Ethiopian Orthodox Church can lead to undernutrition.
   * Nutritional Deficiencies:
   * Risks include iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies, especially in vegan diets.
   * A well-planned lacto-vegetarian diet is generally nutritionally adequate but should be monitored for specific deficiencies.
5. Benefits and Mixed Outcomes
   * Breastfeeding:
   * Prolonged breastfeeding is beneficial in various religions.
   * Alcohol Avoidance:
   * Alcohol abstention in religions like Islam, Mormonism, and Hinduism has significant public health benefits.
   * Vegetarian Diets:
   * Vegetarian diets may lower risks of hypertension, obesity, and blood glucose issues but can also increase risks for stroke and nutrient deficiencies.
6. Health Recommendations for Professionals
   * Understanding religious dietary practices is essential for guiding care, particularly for migrant populations.
   * Nutritional assessments should include BMI evaluation, clinical examination, and monitoring for key nutrients (iron, B12, calcium).
   * Supplementation may be required for populations at risk of deficiencies, especially among women and children.
7. Conclusion
Religious dietary practices are generally neutral but can lead to benefits or deficiencies depending on adherence and socio-economic factors. Healthcare providers must balance understanding patients' spiritual practices with providing adequate nutritional guidance, especially in diverse, global populations.

Slaughtering
	· Must be done according by a « shochet », a religious butcher, who is also in charge of examining the animal in order to rule out any disease.
	 
	· The procedure must be quick, across the throat in a single continuous cutting movement with a sharp knife.
	Blood removing and meat preparation
	· The blood must be drained from the flesh as quickly as possible and the animal is washed clean.
	 
	· After being cut, the meat is soaked in tepid water for 30 minutes and covered in coarse Kosher salt for another hour.
	 
	· Afterwards the meat must be rinsed three times to be ready for cooking and consumption. As much blood as possible must be removed through the process because the blood is perceived as synonymous to life.

Food Allergy Overview
Definition
A food allergy occurs when the body’s immune system abnormally reacts to normally harmless substances, such as proteins found in milk or eggs. This condition is a significant public health issue affecting both children and adults. Globally, up to 250 million people may have food allergies, with most affected by one to three foods. Though over 170 foods have been identified as allergy triggers, eight major allergen groups account for 90% of food allergies. Symptoms can affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and respiratory tract.
Food Allergy vs. Food Intolerance
   * Food Allergy: Involves an immune system reaction to specific proteins in foods.
   * Food Intolerance: Does not involve the immune system but can cause similar symptoms.
Common Food Allergens
   * Egg
   * Milk
   * Peanut
   * Tree Nut
   * Wheat
   * Sesame
   * Soy
   * Fruits and Vegetables
   * Seafood and Shellfish
Click on each allergen to learn about:
   * Specific allergy information
   * Common symptoms
   * Testing details
   * Allergy management
   * Symptom relief
Symptoms of Food Allergies
   * Gastrointestinal: Stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
   * Respiratory: Mild wheezing or coughing, dyspnea (difficult or labored breathing)
   * Dermatological: Itching or tingling in the mouth, lips, or throat, urticaria (rash/hives), intense itching, facial edema (swelling)
   * Systemic: Fatigue, failure to thrive, feeling very hot or very cold, rising anxiety, pale or flushed appearance, hoarseness, croupy/choking cough, very pale/cyanotic lips, unresponsiveness, circulatory collapse
Testing and Management
   * Testing: A blood test (specific IgE) can help identify allergic triggers.
   * Symptom Tracker: Use a symptom tracker to create a profile of your symptoms. Print, scan, or download your results for review with your healthcare provider to determine if further testing is needed.

   * Delayed Introduction: Excessive delay can increase sensitization risk.
   * Clinical Trials:
   * Peanuts: Early introduction reduces allergy risk.
   * Studies: Melbourne study showed a decrease in peanut allergy prevalence with early introduction (from 3.1% to 2.6%).
   * European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Guidelines (2020):
   * Peanuts and Eggs: Introduce during complementary feeding.
   * Cow’s Milk: Avoid supplementation for the first seven days of life.
   * Table of Recommendations: Refer to updated EAACI guidelines for specific details.
4. Growth in Allergic Children
   * Growth Patterns:
   * Inadequate Growth: Documented in allergic children compared to peers.
   * Potential Causes: Food exclusions, sub-inflammatory states, nutrient absorption issues.
   * Obesity Risk: Unbalanced diets and poor food choices.
   * Growth Measurement:
   * Indicators: Weight, length, BMI, head circumference.
   * World Health Organization: Use of z-score units for evaluating nutritional status.
5. Conclusion
   * Nutritional Management: Essential for preventing and treating food allergies.
   * Expert Guidance: Trained dietitians are crucial for creating individualized dietary plans and managing growth.
Dietary Variety and Food Allergy Prevention
   * Dietary Variety:
   * Impact: Limited food choices in the first year of life increase the risk of asthma and allergies, while a varied diet reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis and offers protection against asthma, allergies, and food sensitization.
   * Mechanisms: The connection is unclear, but increased exposure to dietary antigens may play a role.
Treatment of Food Allergies
   * Nutritional Intervention:
   * Objective: Avoid allergic reactions by eliminating the offending food(s) and their derivatives.
   * Challenges:
   * Nutritional Deficiencies: Possible due to food eliminations, necessitating nutritional counseling and growth monitoring, particularly in infants and young children.
   * Psychosocial Impact: Elimination diets can cause anxiety, stress, and social limitations for families and children.
   * Optimal Nutrition: Emphasizes a varied, balanced, and individualized diet to support allergy treatment and overall health. Ensuring nutrient quality and quantity despite exclusions is crucial.
Dietitian’s Role in Dietary Management
   * Early Diagnosis and Care:
   * Diet History: An allergy-focused diet history by a dietitian can guide further diagnostic testing and support final diagnosis.
   * Dietary Assessment: Essential for ensuring appropriate energy and nutrient intake and providing tailored counseling.
   * Growth Concerns:
   * Risk of Growth Retardation: Associated with food allergies, potentially due to early onset or active disease states.
   * Nutritional Intervention: Focus on adequate caloric intake and alternative nutrient sources to support growth and prevent long-term issues.
   * Dietitian’s Tasks:
   * Guidance: Clear instructions on eliminating allergenic foods and their derivatives, label reading, and providing substitute food lists.
   * Nutritional Adequacy: Ensuring proper intakes, identifying deficiencies, and providing supplements if necessary.
   * Specific Diets:
   * Milk Protein Allergy: Use substitute formulas and alternative milks.
   * Wheat Allergy: Avoid wheat and related grains; use alternative grains and pseudo-cereals.
   * Egg Allergy: Balance the diet to compensate for the exclusion of egg proteins.
   * Monitoring and Assessment:
   * Anthropometric Indices: Track weight, height, BMI for growth assessment.
   * Hematochemical Parameters: Assess levels of essential nutrients and overall nutritional status.
   * Diet History: Detailed nutritional history and food diary to address deficiencies and ensure balanced intake.
   * Multidisciplinary Approach:
   * Team Effort: Collaboration between pediatricians, allergologists, dietitians, and educators to manage food allergies effectively.
   * Education: Nutritional education is critical for dietary adequacy and allergen avoidance.
Milk Protein Allergy (CMA)
   * Prevalence and Management:
   * Common Allergy: Increasing prevalence in infants.
   * Recommendations:
   * Breastfed Infants: Mothers should avoid cow’s milk and dairy products.
   * Non-Breastfed Infants: Avoid cow’s milk products and formulas. Use extensively hydrolyzed formulas (eHF) or amino acid-based formulas depending on the risk of anaphylaxis.
   * Guidelines: No specific recommendations for hydrolyzed formulas to prevent IgE-mediated allergies, but they are beneficial for preventing gastrointestinal disorders.
4. Novel Treatment Strategies
4.1. Targeted Nutrition
   * Current Therapeutic Options:
   * Food Allergen Avoidance: The primary method for managing food allergies (FA).
   * Oral or Epicutaneous Immunotherapy: Emerging as potential therapeutic strategies.
   * Emerging Hypotheses:
   * Vitamin D:
   * Association: Studies suggest low serum vitamin D levels may be linked to allergic diseases.
   * Conflicting Evidence:
   * A systematic review found no effect of vitamin D supplementation in preventing allergic diseases during pregnancy or infancy.
   * Some studies indicate high vitamin D levels during pregnancy may increase FA risk by interfering with dendritic cell maturation and T-helper 1 responses.
   * Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LCPUFAs):
   * Role: Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects and may influence allergic reactions.
   * Studies:
   * Maternal intake of omega-3 LCPUFAs during pregnancy can increase LCPUFA concentrations in breast milk and improve immune responses.
   * Clinical trials have shown mixed results, with some indicating reduced rates of atopic eczema and egg sensitization in high-risk infants, while others found no significant differences in allergic outcomes.
   * Hypoallergenic Formulas:
   * Reformulation: New hypoallergenic formulas aim to modulate the gut microbiome and early immune responses by adding lactose and probiotics.
   * Further Research: Needed to refine FA prevention strategies and evaluate their effectiveness on a population level.
4.2. Vitamin D and Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Hypotheses
   * Vitamin D:
   * Low Levels: Associated with increased risk of peanut and egg allergies.
   * High Levels: Some studies suggest high vitamin D levels during pregnancy may be linked to increased FA risk.
   * Current Research: Ongoing trials are evaluating the impact of postnatal vitamin D supplementation on FA and other allergic conditions.
   * Omega-3 LCPUFAs:
   * Pregnancy: Maternal supplementation with omega-3s (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) has been shown to influence immune responses positively.
   * Infancy: Mixed results from trials on the effect of postnatal omega-3 supplementation on allergic sensitization and eczema.
5. Personalized Nutrition
   * Impact of Food Allergies:
   * Quality of Life: FA affects daily life due to dietary restrictions and can lead to anxiety or challenging behaviors in children.
   * Dietitian’s Role:
   * Individualized Plan: Develop a tailored treatment plan considering medical conditions, food avoidance, nutritional needs, and family life.
   * Nutritional Advice: Provide guidance on healthy eating, proper substitutes for excluded foods, and balanced nutrient intake.
   * Food Labels: Teach how to interpret labels to avoid accidental allergen exposure.
   * Reassessment:
   * Periodic Reviews: Essential to monitor dietary compliance and ensure optimal growth and development.
   * Food Tolerance: Some children may tolerate heat-treated allergens (e.g., baked eggs and milk) due to reduced allergenicity through cooking.
   * Personalized Approach:
   * Avoid Unnecessary Restrictions: Ensure a balanced diet while managing allergies effectively.
   * Consider Immunological Mechanisms: Understand different clinical presentations and tolerance levels of food allergies.
6. Discussion
   * Ideal Management:
   * Nutritional Counseling and Growth Monitoring: Key elements in managing FA effectively.
   * Dietitian’s Role:
   * Individualized Plan: Create and adjust nutritional plans based on patient needs.

Intermittent Fasting: The Positive News Continues
Date: February 28, 2021
Author: Harvard Health Publishing Staff
Overview
Intermittent fasting (IF) has shown promising results in animal studies, including weight loss and improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. However, these studies were conducted on rats. Human studies indicate that while IF is safe and effective, it is not necessarily more effective than other diets. Additionally, many individuals find fasting challenging. Recent research suggests that the timing of fasting may enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of IF for weight loss and diabetes prevention.
Background on Intermittent Fasting
   * Historical Popularization:
   * 2012: Dr. Michael Mosley's TV documentary Eat Fast, Live Longer and book The Fast Diet.
   * Subsequent Books:
   * Kate Harrison's The 5:2 Diet.
   * Dr. Jason Fung's The Obesity Code (2016).
   * Fung’s book integrates research, clinical experience, and nutrition advice, emphasizing:
   * Increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, fiber, healthy proteins, and fats.
   * Avoidance of sugar, refined grains, processed foods, and snacking.
Mechanism of Intermittent Fasting
   * Basic Concept:
   * Food is broken down in the gut, with carbohydrates (especially sugars and refined grains) converted to sugar in the bloodstream.
   * Excess sugar is stored as fat if not used for energy.
   * Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps sugar enter fat cells and remain there.
Key Points
   * Effectiveness:
   * Human studies suggest IF is safe and effective but not superior to other diets.
   * Timing of fasting may improve its effectiveness and sustainability.
   * Challenges:
   * Many people find fasting difficult.
Conclusion
Intermittent fasting remains a viable approach for weight loss and diabetes prevention, with its effectiveness potentially enhanced by careful timing.

Introduction
   * The Food Nutrition Service (FNS) under the USDA, administers the Food Stamp Program (FSP), focusing on promoting balanced, healthful diets.
   * To improve FSP participants’ diets, educators need insights into:
   * How households allocate food resources.
   * How food dollars are distributed across key food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, protein).
   * The USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) developed the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) as a national standard for affordable food baskets for low-income households.
   * TFP estimates food costs based on national average prices for at-home consumption, adjusted annually for inflation.
   * TFP costs are scaled based on household size and adjusted for inflation.
   * Research shows that many low-income households spend enough to meet the TFP food basket but also allocate funds to more expensive, less nutritious food-away-from-home (FAFH).
   * This study examines:
   * How closely low-income households match their at-home food budgets to TFP guidelines.
   * How food dollars are allocated across food groups: cereal/bakery, meat/poultry/fish/eggs, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.
   * How changes in income affect food spending for low-income households compared to higher-income households.
Methodology
   * Data Sources:
   * 2002 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) data, reporting household food expenditures over two weeks.
   * CNPP data on TFP food cost estimates adjusted for age, gender, and household size.
   * Food Spending Categories:
   * At-home foods: Groceries bought at stores, food prepared during trips.
   * Away-from-home foods (FAFH): Meals from restaurants, fast food, vending machines, and school lunches.
   * Calculation:
   * The study calculates the ratio of actual household food spending to the TFP-estimated cost for:
   * Total at-home food.
   * Specific food groups: cereal/bakery, meat/poultry/fish/eggs, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.
   * Key Objectives:
   * Assess whether low-income households allocate enough of their food budget to meet TFP standards.
   * Identify which food groups are underfunded or overfunded.
   * Examine how income influences food spending, especially on at-home versus away-from-home food.
   * Analysis:
   * Compare food budget allocation across low-income and higher-income households.
   * Identify patterns where low-income households might deviate from TFP guidelines due to budget constraints or other factors.
Food Security vs. Budget Allocation:
   * The analysis focuses on budget allocation, not food security. A gap between spending and the TFP doesn't indicate food scarcity, just a different allocation than the TFP suggests.
   * Average low-income household spends 1.28 times the TFP cost on total food (at home + away), but the median household matches the TFP cost almost exactly (ratio = 0.99).
Spending on Food Away from Home (FAFH):
   * Low-income households spend about 27% of total food dollars on FAFH, representing potential deviations from a nutritious, low-cost diet.
   * FAFH is usually more expensive and less nutritious than food at home.
   * After accounting for FAFH, low-income households only spend 86% of the TFP on at-home food.
Spending Differences in Households with Children:
   * Couples with children spend only 73% of the TFP on food at home, while female-headed households spend 82%.
   * Free food from pantries or school lunches may offset some of these differences.
Budget Allocation Across Food Groups:
   * The TFP allocates 92% of its cost to four main food groups (cereal/bakery, meat/poultry/fish/eggs, dairy, fruits/vegetables), but low-income households only allocate 71% of their at-home food budget to these groups.
   * Low-income households spend 12% of their at-home food budget on miscellaneous prepared foods and 9% on non-alcoholic beverages.
   * Fats, oils, sugars, and sweets make up another 8% of their budget.
Under-Allocated Food Groups:
   * Fruits and vegetables are the most under-allocated food group, followed by dairy, and then meat, poultry, fish, and eggs.
   * Nutrition educators could focus on increasing spending on fruits/vegetables and promoting healthy diets.
   * Suggestions include color-coded food stamps that allocate a fixed proportion to fruits and vegetables.
Time and Cooking Skills Impact:
   * Low-income households may allocate a significant share of their budget to prepared foods and FAFH due to time constraints and lack of cooking skills.
   * A revised TFP including prepared foods may be necessary, but would require an increase in food stamp allotments to cover the higher costs.
Conclusions:
   * Although low-income households spend roughly the same as the TFP cost on total food, they don't allocate their food dollars in line with the TFP.
   * Households with women and children tend to deviate the most from the TFP, supporting the FNS proposal to target these households for special nutritional education.
   * Further research is needed to examine what specific foods these households acquire, including free foods.




Accessibility to Food

Introduction
   * Importance of Dietary Quality:
   * Unhealthy diets increase the risk of overweight, obesity, and chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.
   * Dietary habits are influenced by a variety of individual, social, and environmental factors.
   * Role of the Environment:
   * Healthy dietary changes are more likely when the environment supports healthful food options.
   * There's growing interest in understanding how the food environment impacts food selection and dietary quality.
   * Definition of Food Environment:
   * The food environment includes everything around individuals that affects their food choices and eating habits.
   * Local retail food environments determine the availability of healthy, nutritious food.
   * Access to Supermarkets vs. Convenience Stores (CS):
   * Better access to supermarkets and limited access to CS has been associated with healthier diets.
   * CS are small stores with mostly ready-to-eat, energy-dense foods, and limited fresh options, potentially encouraging unhealthy eating patterns.
   * Inconsistent Findings on CS and Diet:
   * The association between CS presence and eating patterns has produced inconsistent results across studies.
   * Variability may be due to differences in population density, urban planning, and infrastructure across study areas.
   * Most research has focused on small geographic areas (rural or urban) and has been conducted in the USA and UK.
   * Research Limitations:
   * Previous research often focused on individual dietary components like fruit and vegetable intake, rather than overall diet quality.
   * A more comprehensive score that measures multiple aspects of the diet could provide better insight into dietary healthiness.
   * Study Aim:
   * The article aims to investigate the association between the accessibility of local CS and overall dietary habits in a large Danish adult population across 
   * metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.


Results and Discussion
Association Between Convenience Stores (CS) and Unhealthy Diet:
   * Presence of CS within 500 meters from home was linked to unhealthy diets in non-metropolitan areas.
   * No significant association was found in metropolitan areas.
   * Odds of an unhealthy diet increased with more CS in the neighborhood.
Between-Municipality Variance:
   * Differences in unhealthy diets across municipalities were largely explained by CS density and individual characteristics.
   * High socioeconomic status (SES) clustering in certain neighborhoods contributed to variance.
   * When individual SES factors were considered, area-level SES had no significant effect on diet.
Previous Research & Methodological Variability:
   * Few studies have examined CS accessibility and diet; results are inconsistent due to varying methods (e.g., different measures of density or proximity).
   * This study used a 500 m network buffer zone to measure CS density, reflecting actual walking distance.
Diet Quality Score (DQS):
   * The study used DQS to measure overall dietary intake, which is a better predictor of health and disease risk than individual food items.
   * DQS is linked to healthier diets with higher nutrient intake and lower saturated fats.
   * Diet was self-reported, which may introduce non-differential misclassification and underestimations.
Strengths of the Study:
   * Use of high-quality Danish registers for residence and CS locations.
   * The study used individual-level exposure data to minimize aggregation error.
   * Multilevel logistic regression was used to account for the clustering of individuals with similar characteristics in the same areas.
Findings in Metropolitan Areas:
   * No association between CS density within 250 m and dietary patterns in the metropolitan area of Copenhagen.
   * High availability of food stores in the area might overshadow the influence of CS on diet.
Limitations:
   * Did not examine other types of food stores like grocery stores, supermarkets, or restaurants.
   * Cross-sectional design limits the ability to establish causal relationships between CS and diet.
   * Market forces may drive CS placement based on local demand.
Conclusion:
   * CS accessibility is significantly associated with unhealthy dietary habits, particularly in non-metropolitan areas.
   * Results highlight the importance of local context and area composition in food environment studies.
   * Future research is needed to explore the complete food environment and develop better measures of accessibility and impact.

Results
General Findings:
   * Moderate evidence supports the idea that neighborhood food environments influence dietary health.
   * There is a lack of reproducibility across studies due to the absence of a standard method for measuring local food access.
Perceived vs. GIS-Based Measures:
   * Perceived availability of food stores is consistently related to healthy dietary outcomes.
   * GIS-based accessibility (distance to stores) showed little correlation with dietary outcomes.
   * GIS-based availability measures (store presence and density) showed mixed results.
   * Survey-based perceived accessibility measures were weak and inconsistent.
Unexpected Findings:
   * Some studies found higher fruit and vegetable costs were linked to higher consumption, possibly due to better quality produce in more expensive stores.
   * Perceived affordability measures produced mixed results, possibly due to under-reporting by people who buy little produce.
Variability in Dietary Outcomes:
   * Outcomes varied widely, but fruit and vegetable intake was the most commonly studied.
   * Evidence for associations between fast food outlets and consumption was weak, potentially due to the ubiquity of fast food or individual preferences governing fast food consumption.
Non-US Food Environments:
   * Patterns of food deserts may differ in countries outside the US, Australia, and New Zealand due to different economic segregation histories.
   * Few studies from outside the US and Australia/New Zealand were included in this review, limiting comparisons.
Publication Bias:
   * Studies showing positive relationships between food environments and dietary outcomes are more likely to be published.
   * Most studies in the review showed at least one significant positive relationship, but publication bias may affect the true picture.
Comparison of Methods:
   * GIS-based studies were more common but less consistent in revealing significant relationships between food environments and dietary outcomes.
   * GIS measures fail to capture non-geographic dimensions of access like food affordability, choice, or store accommodation.
   * Geographic boundaries imposed by GIS may not align with what residents consider their neighborhood.
   * Secondary source data used in GIS-based measures may be inaccurate.

Introduction
Sustainable Diets Definition (FAO, 2010):
   * Diets with low environmental impact that support food and nutrition security.
   * Contribute to a healthy life for present and future generations.
   * Respect biodiversity, ecosystems, cultural acceptability, economic fairness, and affordability.
   * Ensure diets are nutritionally adequate, safe, and healthy, while optimizing natural and human resources.
Examples of Sustainable Diets:
   * Plant-Based Diets: Primarily plant foods, limit or avoid animal-based foods.
   * Types of plant-based diets:
   * Flexitarian: Includes eggs, dairy, and occasionally meat, poultry, fish, and seafood.
   * Pescatarian: Includes eggs, dairy, fish, and seafood, but no meat or poultry.
   * Lacto-ovo-vegetarian: Includes eggs and dairy, but no meat, poultry, fish, or seafood.
   * Vegan: Excludes all animal-based foods.
   * These diets are seen as sustainable alternatives to western, animal-based diets and offer potential human and planetary health benefits.
Prevalence of Plant-Based Diets Globally:
   * 19% of people in the Asia Pacific region identify as vegetarians.
   * Only 5% of Europeans and 6% of North Americans identify as vegetarians.
Reasons for Adopting Plant-Based Diets:
   * Health concerns related to current dietary patterns.
   * Animal welfare considerations.
   * Environmental sustainability awareness.
Barriers to Plant-Based Diets:
   * Lack of knowledge about plant-based diets.
   * Perceived palatability of meat.
   * Difficulty in changing eating habits.
   * Influence of personal identity shaped by socio-cultural factors (e.g., cultural traditions, religious beliefs).
   * Support from family, friends, and community.
Influences on Plant-Based Diets:
   * Societal trends and media influence.
   * External factors like food environment:
   * Availability of plant-based options in grocery stores and restaurants.
   * Display and promotion of plant-based foods.
   * Food prices.
Research Aim:
   * Study the reasons for adopting and maintaining plant-based diets in different socio-cultural contexts.
   * Evaluate the availability of plant-based foods and external factors influencing dietary behavior.
   * Insights will help nutrition educators and policymakers promote sustainable diets effectively.


Methodology
2.1 Study Population and Settings
   * Inclusion Criteria:
   * Participants followed plant-based diets (flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, or vegan).
   * Participants recruited from two cities:
   * Loma Linda (LL), California, USA: Small city (~24,000 inhabitants) with additional nearby areas (Redlands, San Bernardino, Riverside).
   * Copenhagen (CPH), Denmark: Larger city (~793,000 inhabitants), including Frederiksberg municipality.

   * Socio-Cultural Context:
   * Loma Linda (LL):
   * One of the five Blue Zones (known for longevity and healthy lifestyle).
   * Predominantly a Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) community.
   * SDA church promotes plant-based diets but permits some animal-based products (eggs, dairy).
   * Copenhagen (CPH):
   * Won the European Green Cities award for green growth and sustainability.
   * Likely participants followed plant-based diets for environmental reasons.
2.2 Questionnaire
   * Structure:
   * Self-administered, web-based, closed questionnaire (22 questions, multiple-choice, single answer).
   * Four categories:
   * Demographics
   * Personal diet and motivation
   * Society and culture
   * External factors
   * Two language versions:
   * English (LL participants)
   * Danish (CPH participants)
   * Questionnaire Model:
   * Based on Stoll-Kleemann and Smith’s model, addressing factors influencing meat-eating behavior.
   * Three sections:
   * Personal/Internal Factors: Knowledge, emotions, habits, perceived control.
   * Socio-Cultural Factors: Culture, religion, social norms, identity.
   * External Factors: Political, economic factors, food environment, availability of plant-based foods.
   * Pilot Test:
   * Conducted with two people from each city to ensure comprehension and content validity.
   * Feedback was incorporated into the final questionnaire.
2.3 Data Collection
   * LL (July-September 2018):
   * Posters posted on public Facebook groups, supermarkets, cafés, and university campuses.
   * Flyers distributed locally and an online newspaper ad posted.

   * Posters posted in seven Facebook groups.
   * No paper posters or flyers due to sufficient online recruitment.
   * Participation:
   * Minimum of 8 respondents per diet category (flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan).
   * At least 40 participants total per location.
   * Voluntary completion implied informed consent (anonymity and research purpose explained).
2.4 Statistical Analyses
   * Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) used to define socio-demographic characteristics, personal diet and motivations, socio-cultural environment, and availability of plant-based products.
   * No comparisons between LL and CPH populations were performed.


Findings
3.1 Sample Demographics
   * Total of 229 participants: 43 from Loma Linda (LL) and 186 from Copenhagen (CPH).

   * More than 75% of participants in both locations were women.
   * Age:
   * Over 50% of participants were between 20-29 years old.
   * Education:
   * High levels of education in both locations.
   * Religion:
   * Over 50% of LL participants followed Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) religion.
   * 70% of CPH participants did not follow any religion.
3.2 Personal Diet and Motivations
   * Dietary Patterns:
   * LL: Flexitarian (39.5%) and Pescatarian (25.6%) diets were the most common.
   * CPH: Nearly 50% of participants identified as vegan.
   * One-third of LL participants had followed their diet for 20+ years, while over 50% of CPH participants had followed a plant-based diet for 1-5 years.
   * Motivations for Starting a Plant-Based Diet:
   * LL: Main motivation was health, followed by social norms and religion.
   * CPH: 40% cited animal welfare; health and environmental concerns were each 22%.
   * Motivations for Maintaining the Diet:
   * LL: Health (69.8%) was the primary reason for maintaining the diet.
   * CPH: Animal welfare (40.9%) and environmental concerns (28.5%) were the top reasons.
   * Non-Vegan Consumption:
   * CPH: 23.7% believed they already consumed enough plant-based products.
   * LL: Only 11.4% felt the same.
   * LL Participants: Desired more availability of plant-based foods in restaurants and cafés, and lower prices.
   * CPH Participants: Support from family and friends, lower prices, and convenience could boost plant-based consumption.
3.3 Socio-Cultural Environment
   * Dietary Patterns in Family/Friends:
   * LL: 51.2% followed different diets than family; 72.1% had different diets than friends.
   * CPH: 79% had different diets than family; 85.5% from friends.
   * Omnivorous diets were the most common for relatives and friends in both locations.
   * Social Pressure and Dietary Compromise:
   * Most participants rarely compromised their diets due to social pressure.
   * CPH: More participants reported compromising their diet “very often.”
   * Diet and Religion:
   * LL: 65.1% associated plant-based diets with religion or spiritual beliefs.
   * CPH: 86.6% did not associate plant-based diets with religion.
   * Diet Associations:
   * LL: Lacto-ovo-vegetarianism associated with health-promoting lifestyles; veganism linked to health, religion, and animal rights.
   * CPH: Plant-based diets linked to animal rights and climate change concerns.
3.4 Availability of Plant-Based Foods
   * Shopping for Plant-Based Foods:
   * Both groups reported availability of plant-based options, though LL had higher supermarket availability.
   * Both groups found plant-based foods more expensive, especially in CPH.
   * Work/Study Availability:
   * LL: 55.8% said both lacto-ovo-vegetarian and vegan options were available where they work/study.
   * CPH: 48.3% reported vegan options were not available at their work/study place.
   * Restaurants:
   * Both groups reported that most restaurants offered lacto-ovo-vegetarian meals, with fewer offering vegan options.
Discussion
   * Influence of Socio-Cultural Background:
   * Dietary decisions are influenced by environment and socio-cultural factors.
   * Religion was a significant differentiator:
   * LL: Religion (mainly Seventh-Day Adventist) played a major role in plant-based diet adoption and maintenance.
   * CPH: Religion was not a motivating factor, and plant-based diets were unrelated to religious beliefs.
   * Demographic Insights:
   * The majority of participants in both LL and CPH were young, educated women, consistent with prior studies linking plant-based diets to these demographics.
   * Dietary Motivations:
   * LL: Health was the primary motivation for both adopting (53.5%) and maintaining (69.8%) a plant-based diet.
   * CPH: Animal welfare was the top reason for adopting the diet, followed by environmental/climate change concerns.
   * Differences between the two groups reflect their distinct social and cultural contexts.
   * Vegan vs. Flexitarian:
   * LL: 65% of participants identified as flexitarian or pescatarian.
   * CPH: 50% of participants were vegan, highlighting a stronger focus on animal welfare in CPH compared to LL.
   * Socio-Cultural Influences and Social Networks:
   * Social networks influence dietary habits:
   * Participants in both locations were more likely to follow plant-based diets if their peers did as well.
   * CPH: Higher levels of dietary compromise due to social pressure, possibly due to fewer plant-based peers.
   * LL: Less dietary compromise, likely due to stronger religious and community support for plant-based diets.
   * External Factors Influencing Dietary Patterns:
   * Adequate infrastructure and availability of plant-based options are key to promoting plant-based diets.
   * Participants expressed willingness to increase plant-based food consumption if there were more affordable and accessible options in restaurants and supermarkets.
   * Both groups viewed plant-based foods as more expensive than meat-based products, which could be a barrier to adoption.
   * Availability of Plant-Based Foods:
   * LL: Slightly better access to plant-based foods in supermarkets compared to CPH.
   * CPH: Limited availability of vegan options at work/study places compared to LL.
   * Despite this, both groups reported sufficient access to lacto-ovo-vegetarian options.
   * Price and Affordability:
   * Plant-based alternatives (e.g., meat analogs, plant-based milk) were perceived as expensive.
   * Nobody adopted plant-based diets due to cost savings, indicating price was not a major motivator.
   * Policy and Food Industry Support:
   * Governments, health professionals, and the food industry must support the transition to plant-based diets through subsidies, affordable options, and restaurant offerings.
   * Study Limitations:
   * Questionnaire Validation: The survey was not previously validated and may have selection bias due to recruitment differences in LL and CPH (LL recruitment included general Facebook groups).
   * Sample Size: LL sample size was small, and recruitment methods differed between locations.
   * Dietary Self-Declaration: Participants self-reported their dietary patterns, which may not have been validated with a food diary.
   * Demographic Information: Additional socio-demographic data (e.g., race, socio-economic status) could have been collected.

Social Influences on Food Intake:
   * Laboratory evidence shows social influences can significantly increase or decrease food intake.
   * These findings primarily come from studies on snacking or single meals, often in controlled environments.
Generalization to Natural Settings:
   * It's unclear if the laboratory results apply to natural, everyday food consumption over extended periods.
   * To explore this, researchers re-analyzed diet diary data from previous studies (de Castro et al.).
Study Methodology:
   * Subjects kept a diary of everything they ate and drank over seven consecutive days, including the time, preparation method, and presence of other people.
   * Participants: Over 700 North Americans, aged 18-70, from various regions.
Key Findings:
   * Meals eaten with others were, on average, 44% larger than meals eaten alone.
   * The number of people present positively correlated with meal size, independent of other variables.
   * Social facilitation affects meal size but not meal frequency.
Potential Artifacts:
   * Factors like meal timing, alcohol consumption, snacking vs. full meals, restaurant dining, and weekday vs. weekend eating were examined.
   * These covariates did not fully explain the social correlation with meal size.
Systematic Analysis:
   * Meal size increased in an orderly fashion as more people were present:
   * 1 person = 33% increase, 2 people = 47%, and up to 96% increase with 7 or more people.
   * A power function describes the relationship between meal size and the number of people present.
Additional Influences:
   * Females ate more when dining with males.
   * Meals with spouses, family, or friends were larger than meals with co-workers.
Causal Evidence:
   * Manipulated study: Subjects ate 11% less when instructed to eat alone.
   * Laboratory studies confirmed that eating with others increases food intake.
Magnitude of Effect:
   * The effect of eating alone was smaller than social facilitation seen in unmanipulated settings.
   * Subjects may compensate during manipulated alone conditions by increasing their meal size.


INHERITANCE OF SOCIAL FACILITATION OF EATING
   * The study analyzed diet-diary data from over 50 pairs of male and female identical twins, and over 50 pairs of male, female, and mixed-gender fraternal twins.
   * The goal was to investigate genetic influence on food and fluid intake, using linear structural modeling techniques.
Genetic Influence on Eating Behavior:
   * Genes affect not just body size but also the overall amount of food and fluid intake, including meal frequency, timing, and composition (de Castro, 1993a).
   * Genetic influences on intake were found to be mostly independent of body size.
   * Inheritance affects both meal size and frequency, even when controlling for overall daily intake (de Castro, 1993c).
Social Facilitation and Genetic Influence:
   * The study also examined how genes might influence the social aspects of eating, such as the number of people an individual tends to eat with.
   * Heredity accounted for over 20% of the variance in the number of companions at meals, suggesting a genetic basis for social eating patterns.
   * Heredity also influenced the types of companions (e.g., family, friends, spouse) with whom individuals ate, explaining over 25% of the variance for these groups (de Castro, 1997).
Genetic Influence on Social Facilitation of Intake:
   * The genes also influenced the impact companions had on the amount of food eaten.
   * The association between the number of companions and meal size was found to be heritable.
   * For each additional person present, meal size increased by an average of over 20% (292 kJ).
   * Individual differences in how much meal size increased with additional companions were also largely heritable, with over 30% of the variance in these differences explained by genes (de Castro, 1997).
Conclusion:
   * Both the number of people present during meals and the influence they have on meal size are significantly affected by genetics.
Effect of Culture on Eating
Study Overview:
   * The study compared the eating behaviors of college students in France, the Netherlands, and North America to determine the influence of culture on food intake and eating patterns. The goal was to assess whether previously observed behaviors were culturally specific or universal.
Key Findings on Intake Differences:
   * Dutch students had significantly higher energy intakes compared to French and American students, even after adjusting for body weight. Dutch males and females consumed an average of 12.7 and 9.1 MJ respectively, compared to 9.9 and 7.8 MJ for French students and 10.0 and 7.2 MJ for American students.
   * The Dutch diet was higher in carbohydrates and lower in fat and protein, while French students consumed diets higher in fat.
Differences in Eating Patterns:
   * Dutch students showed a "nibbling" eating pattern, characterized by frequent small meals with shorter intervals between them.
   * The Dutch students ate with more people and at a slower pace, yet their meals were small relative to the time since their previous meal, resulting in higher deprivation ratios and shorter satiety periods compared to French and American students.
   * French students tended to eat larger meals in the early afternoon, with longer post-meal intervals, while Americans consumed progressively larger meals throughout the day.
Cultural Variability in Meal Timing:
   * Dutch students exhibited a diurnal eating pattern with increasing meal sizes in the evening, a behavior also observed in Dutch elderly populations, which suggests this pattern is culturally ingrained rather than unique to students.
   * French students, in contrast, consumed larger meals earlier in the day without significant increases in evening meal size.
   * Americans displayed a pattern of increasing meal size throughout the day, though their intervals between meals remained relatively consistent.
Social Factors:
   * Social facilitation (i.e., eating more when dining with others) was present across all three cultures. Dutch students tended to eat with more people on average, yet the correlation between meal size and the number of companions was consistent across nationalities.
   * The study noted that genetic and physiological factors likely drive social facilitation of intake, as the correlations were strong across all cultures.
Hunger and Meal Size:
   * Despite differing self-reported hunger levels, all nationalities showed a strong correlation between subjective hunger and meal size.
   * American students reported higher hunger at the start of a meal and lower satiety afterward compared to French and Dutch students.
   * The relationship between pre-meal hunger and meal size remained consistent across cultures, indicating that the hunger-intake relationship might represent a common physiological process.
Stomach Content and Hunger:
   * Dutch students had more food energy in their stomachs before meals than French or American students, but all nationalities exhibited significant negative correlations between stomach content and pre- and post-meal hunger.
   * This suggests a universal relationship between stomach content and subjective hunger regardless of cultural differences.
Meal Interval and Intake:
   * Although the Dutch had shorter intervals between meals, the relationship between meal size and the duration of the interval since the previous meal was consistent across the cultures.
Conclusion:
   * While cultural differences exist in overall intake, meal composition, and timing, many of the psychological, social, and physical factors influencing food intake appear to be universal.
   * However, the study's findings may be limited to affluent Western industrialized societies and predominantly Caucasian university student populations. Broader conclusions about other cultures or racial groups cannot be drawn based on these data.

Basic building blocks of flavor:
   * Sweetness: Associated with sugars and some artificial sweeteners.
   * Sourness: Caused by acids.
   * Saltiness: Associated with salts.
   * Bitterness: Often found in certain vegetables, coffee, and dark chocolate.
   * Umami: A savory taste found in foods like meats, mushrooms, and soy sauce.
   * Aroma: A significant portion of flavor comes from the sense of smell. Aromas are perceived through the nose and contribute to the overall flavor experience.

   * Layering: Build layers of flavor by incorporating ingredients at different stages of the cooking process. This allows the flavors to meld and develop complexity.
   * Taste as You Go: Regularly taste your dish as you cook. Adjust seasonings and ingredients to ensure a well-balanced flavor profile.
incorporating Flavor Profiles into Meal Prep
Once you have a basic understanding of flavor profiles, you can truly get creative when meal prepping. Follow this formula to make a delicious meal prep recipe from scratch:
   * Choose your flavor profile. Either start with one of the options listed in my Ingredients Pairing cheat sheet or create your own. 
   * Create a marinade, spice blend or dressing. Use it to season the ingredients in your dish. Check out the Dressings, Sauces, Marinades & Spice Mixes category page on my site for some ideas. 
   * Choose a protein. You can pick a meat (like chicken, beef or pork) or a vegetarian protein source like chickpeas, tofu, beans or lentils.  
   * Add vegetables. Choose any you have on hand such as bell peppers, carrots or tomatoes.
   * Add a starch. Finish building out your dish with a starch like sweet potatoes, corn, rice, quinoa, pasta or bread.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the **American Heart Association’s (AHA) 2010 Dietary Guidelines for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease**:
Sourve 1 https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181e8edf1


### **1. Fat Consumption**
   - **Saturated fats**: Limit to less than 7% of total daily calories.
   - **Trans fats**: Avoid entirely.
   - **Total fat intake**: 25–35% of daily caloric intake, emphasizing unsaturated fats.


### **2. Cholesterol**
   - Limit to **<300 mg/day** (general population) and **<200 mg/day** (at-risk individuals).


### **3. Proteins**
   - Prefer **plant-based proteins** (e.g., legumes, nuts).
   - Include **fish** (especially omega-3 rich fish) twice weekly.


### **4. Carbohydrates**
   - Emphasize **fiber-rich sources** like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.


### **5. Fiber**
   - Aim for **25-30 g/day** of dietary fiber from natural sources.


### **6. Sodium and Salt**
   - Reduce sodium intake to **<1,500 mg/day**, especially for hypertensive and at-risk individuals.


### **7. Alcohol**
   - Consume in moderation: **up to one drink/day** for women, **two drinks/day** for men.


### **8. Physical Activity**
   - Engage in **150 minutes of moderate exercise** or **75 minutes of vigorous exercise** weekly.


### **9. Body Weight**
   - Maintain a **healthy body weight** in relation to height to lower cardiovascular risks.


### **10. Calories**

Article Summary: Applying Physical Activity Intervention Principles to Dietary Habits
Key Findings
   * Informational interventions can be effective when combined with other approaches. While providing information about healthy eating can be helpful, it's often not sufficient on its own.
   * Behavioral and social interventions are particularly effective in promoting dietary changes. This includes strategies like goal setting, self-monitoring, social support, and behavior modification techniques.
   * Environmental and policy interventions can create supportive environments for healthy eating. This involves factors like food availability, accessibility, and affordability, as well as policies that promote healthy food choices.
Implications for Dietary Interventions
   1. Combine multiple approaches: For optimal results, dietary interventions should incorporate a variety of strategies, including informational, behavioral, and environmental components.
   2. Focus on behavior change: Rather than simply providing information about healthy eating, interventions should focus on helping individuals develop and maintain healthy eating behaviors.
   3. Create supportive environments: Encourage healthy food choices by making healthy options more accessible, affordable, and appealing. This can involve working with grocery stores, restaurants, and policymakers to promote healthier food environments.
Specific Strategies for Dietary Interventions
   * Goal setting: Help individuals set realistic and achievable goals for their dietary changes.
   * Self-monitoring: Encourage individuals to track their food intake and physical activity to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
   * Social support: Provide opportunities for individuals to connect with others who are also working on their dietary habits.
   * Behavior modification techniques: Teach individuals how to identify and overcome barriers to healthy eating, such as emotional eating or cravings.
   * Environmental interventions: Promote healthy food choices by making healthy options more available and affordable. This can involve working with schools, workplaces, and communities to create healthier food environments.
Additional Considerations
   * Tailoring interventions: Interventions should be tailored to the individual needs and preferences of the participants.
   * Addressing barriers: It's important to identify and address any barriers that individuals may face in adopting healthy eating habits.
   * Long-term sustainability: Focus on creating sustainable changes that can be maintained over time.
By applying these principles, interventions can effectively support individuals in making and maintaining healthy dietary changes.
