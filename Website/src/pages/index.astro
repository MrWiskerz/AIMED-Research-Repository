    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost and difficulty
      that comes from consulting dietitians or the overwhelming amount of
      nutritional information online makes creating a personalized diet plan
      challenging for average consumers. For many, balancing personal dietary
      needs, preferences, and health conditions is complicated and time
      consuming; an AI personalized diet tool may alleviate this struggle. To
      accomplish this, extensive information including guidelines for various
      diet plans, nutritional values of common food, dietary restrictions, and
      optimal diets for certain health goals is gathered from nutrition
      databases, research papers, peer-reviewed journals, and systematic reviews
      to create a dataset on diet formation. Training the Gemini 1.5 Flash
      machine-learning(ML) model, using linguistic processing of structured data
      text allows users to input information in regards to their current health,
      diet, goals and preferences for processing. Once processed, this
      information results in a personalized diet based on user input. This
      includes multiple options for detailed meals, and their nutrient
      information. A double-blind experiment is then conducted where
      participants rate both dietary plans based on: well being, personal
      satisfaction, cultural inclusion, and activity inclusion. Results indicate
      84.4% of participants prefer the trained model’s diet plan. In total,
      participants report the trained model poses 9.30% betterment in cultural
      inclusion, 14.6% in well-being, 5.49% in personal satisfaction, 6.23%
      betterment of profiling, and 3.98% in activity inclusion. Total mean
      improvement is 8.13%, demonstrating success in all criteria.

    <h2>Background Research</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many health
      issues that we are facing today in the United States which can be partly
      or completely attributed to the average American diet. An example of this
      is the obesity epidemic in America. According to the National Institute of
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 42.4% of adults in America
      have obesity. Taking 42 percent of the estimated adult population of the
      U.S. shows that to be almost 110 Million people. In the United States, the
      factors of greatest influence for obesity are a lack of physical activity,
      and importantly, an unhealthy diet. With the amount of processed foods and
      sugar filled desserts that have become routine for consumption in the
      U.S., it is no surprise this is occurring. From 1999, obesity has only
      been on an upward trend in the United States, with it starting off from
      30% in 1999. In 2024, The United States is ranked as the tenth highest
      country in obesity rates by percentage by World Obesity.
    </p><p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond obesity, diet has
      shown to be a major contributor to various chronic diseases common in
      America according to the National Library of Medicine. 6 of the 10 major
      killing diseases in America, Heart disease, atherosclerosis, stroke,
      cancer, diabetes mellitus, and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, are
      very strongly connected to dietary consumption, and they combined account
      for nearly 70% of deaths in America. Additionally, less immediately
      life-threatening diseases like high blood pressure are also strongly
      influenced and are most likely a result of poor diets in America, and over
      57 Million Americans suffer with high blood pressure.
    </p><p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues prompted
      further research into what was being done to remedy these issues, and why
      these issues persist despite these remedies. According to Stanford
      Medicine, about 80 percent of people who lose weight from a diet gain the
      weight back not too soon after. This is a result of many factors. One
      being people trying to take drastic measures to lose weight, like extreme
      decreases in caloric intake, which leads to extreme decreases in their
      metabolic rate. This means returning to a regular diet will likely result
      in further weight gain. Additionally, these diets are so drastic that they
      may result in fatigue, loss of motivation, and returning to worse eating
      habits after completion as a “reward” or “return” back to normal life,
      which is in reality a bad lifestyle. The issue is that very few people
      create diets which create good lifelong lifestyle changes, rather than
      temporary changes. These lifestyle changes would be easier, longer term
      adjustments which both help with weight loss and also preventing chronic
      illnesses, however, many struggle making these changes as it may be
      difficult to understand what constitutes healthy lifestyle changes and a
      healthy diet. That was one of the motivations behind this research that
      prompted the research and creation of this tool.
    </p><p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvard health publishing
      reaffirms this. They discuss how in the timeframe of only a few months,
      lost weight is regained, and often, it is due to a disability to follow
      the diet, and make lifelong changes. This lack of ability to follow the
      diet comes from excessive restriction which leads to disdain, and often
      unappealing foods to consume. This was seen to even be consistent among
      the majority of the most common diets used for rapid weight loss. What was
      also found was that these diets, such as weight watchers, keto, and the
      mediterranean diet, end up being very little effective, and end up causing
      more harm as they can contribute to other chronic issues such as high
      cholesterol levels. This means that for many people, there is no right
      diet and they really have no place to go to find the perfect lifestyle
      diet personalized to allow good lifestyle changes while also being easy to
      consume.
    </p><p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has led people to go
      for some other “last resort efforts” which are even more dangerous and
      potentially threatening for their long term health. The aforementioned
      remedies are GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic, being used for weight loss.
      About 12 percent of the Adult population makes use of such drugs, with 40
      percent of those users using it for the sake of weight loss according to
      KFF. This can have adverse effects on people's health, as many gain a
      dependency on the drug to keep their weight low, some have gotten addicted
      to such drugs, and others suffer day to day side effects such as immense
      nausea. Not only does this result in immense financial burden on the
      people making use of these drugs, but it also has resulted in a shortage,
      which has been terrible for the many people who use these drugs to help
      live with and treat other chronic conditions which require the use of the
      drug. Some of the side effects include gastrointestinal issues such as
      vomiting and diarrhea, as well as lightheadedness and dizziness.
    </p><p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at all of the
      diet stemmed issues in America, and many of the failed attempts to remedy
      them, we became motivated to research the best methods for creating diets
      which surpass these particular obstacles and issues and allow for
      lifelong, comfortable lifestyle changes which allow people to accomplish
      their dietary goals.
