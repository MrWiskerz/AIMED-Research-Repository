Factors that predict weight loss success differ by diet intervention type
1. Introduction
Overweight and obesity are global public health concerns, affecting around 2 billion adults and nearly 400 million children and adolescents worldwide (1). A market survey conducted with 22,008 individuals from 30 countries revealed that 45–60% of people are actively trying to lose weight (2). These numbers highlight the critical need to identify key determinants for successful weight loss strategies (3). Although a variety of diets can achieve weight loss by creating a negative energy balance, a successful diet is defined as one that results in a loss of at least 5% of baseline body weight while also improving cardiometabolic health (4).
Common weight loss strategies include manipulating macronutrient composition (e.g., low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets) and reducing total energy intake (low-calorie diets). Low-carbohydrate diets are promoted based on the idea that they increase satiety and stimulate fat burning through the carbohydrate-insulin model (5). Conversely, low-fat diets aim to prevent weight gain and reduce cardiovascular disease risk (6), while low-calorie diets focus on creating a calorie deficit. However, adaptive thermogenesis can make weight loss challenging and increase the likelihood of regaining lost weight (7).
Research indicates that various diet types can lead to weight loss with similar outcomes. A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found that low-carbohydrate diets resulted in slightly greater weight loss than low-fat diets at six months, but this difference was no longer significant at 12 months (8). A larger meta-analysis of 121 randomized controlled trials found minimal differences in weight loss between low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets at six months, with no significant differences at 12 months (9). Thus, any diet adhered to over time can result in weight loss (10).
Despite the effectiveness of various diets, weight loss responses can vary significantly among individuals, even within the same dietary intervention. For instance, a 12-month trial of four popular diets showed weight changes ranging from a loss of 30 kg to a gain of 10 kg within each group (11). These variations suggest that individual biological, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors influence diet efficacy. The current study aims to identify factors that impact weight loss success across diets with varying macronutrient and caloric compositions, providing insight into personalizing dietary approaches for better outcomes.
2. Methods
2.1. Recruitment and Eligibility
Participants were recruited for dietary weight loss interventions conducted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between 2016 and 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1). Recruitment strategies included flyers posted in various locations and email announcements via the VUMC research listserv. Eligible participants were aged 21–60 years, with a BMI of 30.0 to 49.9 kg/m² and weight stability in the three months prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of various diseases (e.g., diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease), recent surgeries, food allergies, alcohol abuse, smoking, and pregnancy. Participants gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the VUMC Institutional Review Board.
2.2. Diet Interventions
Participants self-selected one of three diet interventions lasting 4–6 months. Each diet was designed with specific macronutrient goals:
Low carbohydrate (LOW CHO): 30% carbohydrate, 50% fat, 20% protein
Low fat (LOW FAT): 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 20% protein
Low calorie (LOW KCAL): A calorie reduction of 500 kcal/day from baseline intake, with a macronutrient distribution identical to LOW FAT
Resting energy expenditure was measured via metabolic cart to tailor calorie goals for weight loss.
2.3. Diet Assessment
Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour diet recall interviews following the validated U.S. Department of Agriculture five-step multi-pass methodology. The Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R) software was used to analyze energy intake, macronutrient composition, and micronutrient levels. Food intake was categorized into 12 subgroups for analysis, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins (Supplementary Table S1).
2.4. Anthropometry, Body Composition, and Resting Energy Expenditure
Body measurements, including height, weight, waist/hip circumference, and body composition, were taken at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured using a metabolic cart, and body composition was assessed via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
2.5. Clinical Biomarkers
Blood and urine samples were collected to assess biomarkers, including glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Plasma leptin levels were measured, and HOMA-IR was calculated to assess insulin resistance.
2.6. Questionnaires
Participants completed several questionnaires, including the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) to assess eating disorder risk and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale to evaluate depression. Physical activity levels were assessed using the Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment Questionnaire (PACT-Q).
2.7. Statistical Analysis
Baseline differences between diet groups were analyzed using chi-square or ANOVA. Age, sex, and BMI were included as covariates. Multivariate regression models were developed to assess the impact of various factors on weight loss, with predictors removed via forward-backward stepwise regression. Logistic regression was used to assess weight loss success (≥5% baseline weight) and intervention completion. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
3. Results
Among 305 participants, 65% were white and 35% identified as Black or other. The LOW CHO group was 100% female, while the LOW KCAL group had older participants with higher glucose and insulin levels. A total of 48% of participants met the criteria for Class I obesity (BMI 30.0–34.9), 42% for Class II obesity (BMI 35.0–39.9), and 10% for Class III obesity (BMI ≥40.0).
4. Discussion
The current study adds to the body of evidence indicating that no single diet is superior for weight loss. Meta-analyses have shown that diet composition (e.g., low carbohydrate vs low fat) does not significantly impact energy expenditure or weight loss over time (24). Individuals can choose a diet based on personal preferences without compromising weight loss outcomes. However, specific factors, such as demographic characteristics, body composition, and clinical biomarkers, can influence weight loss success across different diet types.
4.1 Demographic Predictors
Age, race, and education level were significant predictors of weight loss success. Older individuals and those with higher education levels tended to lose more weight, possibly due to greater available time, resources, and social support. Racial differences in weight loss were observed, particularly for African-American women, which may be due to a combination of genetic, cultural, and environmental factors.
4.2 Biological Predictors
Baseline body fat percentage and serum leptin levels were significant predictors of weight loss in the LOW CHO and LOW FAT groups. Leptin resistance, often associated with higher body fat, may hinder weight loss. Higher LDL cholesterol and blood pressure were also associated with weight loss, particularly in the LOW FAT and LOW KCAL groups, likely because participants with cardiometabolic concerns were more motivated to lose weight.
4.3 Intervention Completion
The most significant predictor of weight loss success was intervention completion, accounting for 20–30% of the variance in outcomes. Weight loss progress itself was the strongest motivator for participants to complete the intervention. Older participants had higher adherence rates, while younger adults, who face more lifestyle challenges, had higher dropout rates.
4.4 Cardiometabolic Improvements
Weight loss success (≥5% of baseline weight) was associated with improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors across all three diet types, including reductions in blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and C-reactive protein. These findings support the idea that even modest weight loss can lead to significant health benefits.
5. Conclusion
The study underscores the importance of intervention completion for successful weight loss. While no single diet type is superior, aligning dietary interventions with an individual’s specific cardiometabolic risk profile may yield the most significant health improvements. Future research should investigate long-term maintenance strategies and the role of exercise in enhancing weight loss outcomes.

Intermittent Fasting: The Positive News Continues
Date: February 28, 2021
Author: Harvard Health Publishing Staff
Overview
Intermittent fasting (IF) has shown promising results in animal studies, including weight loss and improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. However, these studies were conducted on rats. Human studies indicate that while IF is safe and effective, it is not necessarily more effective than other diets. Additionally, many individuals find fasting challenging. Recent research suggests that the timing of fasting may enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of IF for weight loss and diabetes prevention.
Background on Intermittent Fasting
* Historical Popularization:
   * 2012: Dr. Michael Mosley's TV documentary Eat Fast, Live Longer and book The Fast Diet.
   * Subsequent Books:
      * Kate Harrison's The 5:2 Diet.
      * Dr. Jason Fung's The Obesity Code (2016).
   * Fung’s book integrates research, clinical experience, and nutrition advice, emphasizing:
      * Increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, fiber, healthy proteins, and fats.
      * Avoidance of sugar, refined grains, processed foods, and snacking.
Mechanism of Intermittent Fasting
* Basic Concept:
   * Food is broken down in the gut, with carbohydrates (especially sugars and refined grains) converted to sugar in the bloodstream.
   * Excess sugar is stored as fat if not used for energy.
   * Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps sugar enter fat cells and remain there.
Key Points
* Effectiveness:
   * Human studies suggest IF is safe and effective but not superior to other diets.
   * Timing of fasting may improve its effectiveness and sustainability.
* Challenges:
   * Many people find fasting difficult.
Conclusion
Intermittent fasting remains a viable approach for weight loss and diabetes prevention, with its effectiveness potentially enhanced by careful timing.

Calorie Restriction and Fasting Diets: Overview
Introduction
Calorie restriction (CR) and fasting diets have gained attention for their potential health benefits, distinguishing them from traditional dieting aimed solely at weight loss.
Definitions
* Calorie Restriction (CR): Reducing daily caloric intake below typical levels without malnutrition.
* Fasting Diet: Periods of no food intake or severely limited intake, which may lead to reduced overall calorie consumption.
Research Context
Research on CR and fasting is focused on their roles in promoting health and longevity, supported by decades of animal studies that suggest these eating patterns may delay age-related disorders.
________________


Forms of Calorie Restriction and Fasting
* Calorie Restriction: A consistent reduction in daily caloric intake.
* Fasting Regimens: Focus on the timing of food intake, including:
   * Time-Restricted Feeding: Eating within a specific time frame each day (e.g., 6-8 hours).
   * Alternate-Day Fasting: No caloric intake or minimal calories every other day.
   * 5:2 Eating Pattern: Normal eating for 5 days, followed by 2 days of caloric restriction.
   * Periodic Fasting: Restricting calories for several consecutive days at intervals.
________________


Evidence from Animal Studies
* Many studies show that calorie restriction (10-40% fewer calories) in various animals can extend lifespan and reduce disease rates.
* For example:
   * C. elegans (worms) saw a 40% lifespan increase with fasting.
   * Some rodent studies indicated that lifelong alternate-day fasting may delay cancer onset.
* Research on rhesus monkeys has provided mixed results regarding longevity but suggests reduced incidence of age-related conditions.
________________


Evidence from Human Studies of Calorie Restriction
* Limited long-term human data exist on CR and longevity.
* A notable trial, CALERIE, involved 218 adults following a calorie-restricted diet for 2 years, resulting in reduced risk factors for age-related diseases and sustained weight loss.
* Participants experienced no significant adverse effects on quality of life, though some mild declines in bone density and aerobic capacity were noted.
________________


Evidence from Human Studies of Fasting
* Research primarily focuses on weight loss in obese individuals; fewer studies explore long-term benefits.
* Observational studies suggest fasting may correlate with reduced coronary artery disease risk, but factors like diet quality were not controlled.
________________


Mechanisms Behind Calorie Restriction and Fasting
* Research has not definitively explained how CR extends lifespan.
* Proposed mechanisms include:
   * Modulation of inflammation, metabolism, and oxidative stress.
   * Intermittent fasting may utilize fat reserves, producing ketones that benefit brain function and reduce cancer risk.
________________


Research Challenges and Uncertainties
* Most studies are animal-based, making it difficult to extrapolate findings to humans.
* Human trials often focus on short-term weight loss, lacking insights into aging.
* Variability in human responses based on genetics, lifestyle, and other factors complicates research.
* Accurate tracking of human dietary intake poses additional challenges.
Conclusion
While calorie restriction and fasting diets show promise based on preliminary evidence, further research is needed to establish their long-term effects on health and aging in humans. Caution is advised before adopting these eating patterns.
Weight Gain Diets: Diets for weight gain
Source #1: https://www.maxinutrition.com/blogs/sports/4-week-bulking-transformation-diet
Key Points on Bulking
Overview
* Bulk Phase: Focus on consuming more calories to promote muscle growth, followed by a cutting phase to reduce fat.
* Training & Nutrition: Effective bulking requires disciplined training and a calorie-rich, nutrient-dense diet.
* Not Just Eating More: Bulking is about strategically feeding your muscles, not simply overeating.
Bulking Strategy
1. Caloric Surplus: Calculate your maintenance calories (about 2500 for men, 2000 for women) and add approximately 500 calories (a 20% surplus) to support muscle growth.
2. Hydration: Drink 1.5 – 2 liters (6-8 glasses) of water daily. Milk can provide extra protein; consider slow-release protein like Micellar Casein before bed.
3. Carbohydrates: Focus on whole grains for sustained energy and include simple carbs post-workout for quick recovery.
4. Protein Intake: Aim for 2g of protein per kg of bodyweight daily, incorporating protein in every meal.
5. Healthy Fats: Include energy-dense healthy fats such as nuts, avocado, and oily fish while limiting saturated and trans fats.
6. Supplements: Use mass gainers to increase calorie intake without excessive eating. Creatine supports high-intensity workouts and promotes muscle growth.
Meal Frequency
* Increase meal frequency to 6-8 smaller meals daily to make it easier to consume the required calories.
Sample 4-Week Bulking Diet
* Aim: Consume 6 nutrient-dense meals daily while avoiding a “dirty bulk” to prevent excessive fat gain.
Breakfast Options (Choose One Daily)
* 6 egg omelette with spinach (~564 kcal)

Microminerals
* Iron, Copper, Zinc, Selenium, Iodine: Required in smaller amounts (<100 mg/day), each with specific physiological roles.
Minerals and Their Roles in Human Health
Phosphorus
Phosphorus is an essential macromineral that serves as a structural component of bones and teeth, DNA, RNA, and cellular membranes. It is vital for energy production and storage, participating in ATP synthesis. Major dietary sources of phosphorus include milk, dairy products, meat, and poultry, as well as processed foods where it often acts as a preservative. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults is 700 mg/day, ensuring adequate physiological functions and bone health.
Sodium
Sodium is an essential macromineral and electrolyte, critical for cellular membrane transport, maintaining water balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction. Common sources include table salt, processed foods, meat, milk, eggs, and vegetables. While the Adequate Intake (AI) for sodium in adults is set at 1,500 mg/day, typical consumption in industrialized nations often exceeds 3,000 to 4,500 mg/day, raising concerns about health risks associated with high sodium intake, such as hypertension.
Potassium
Potassium is another essential macromineral and electrolyte, crucial for muscle contraction, nerve function, blood pH balance, and fluid balance, acting as the most abundant intracellular cation. Rich sources of potassium include fruits and vegetables. The AI for potassium for adults is 4,700 mg/day, reflecting its importance in countering sodium’s effects and supporting cardiovascular health.
Chloride
Chloride is an essential macromineral and the primary extracellular anion, playing a significant role in digestion, muscular activity, water balance, and maintaining acid-base balance. Dietary chloride is typically consumed as sodium chloride (table salt) and is found in processed foods, meat, milk, eggs, and vegetables. The AI for chloride for adults is 1,500 mg/day, essential for maintaining electrolyte balance and stomach acidity.
Iron
Iron is an essential trace mineral crucial for oxygen transport and energy metabolism. It exists in two forms: heme iron from animal sources (meat and fish) and non-heme iron from plant sources (fortified grains and vegetables). The bioavailability of heme iron is higher, making it easier for the body to absorb. The RDA for iron varies by gender, set at 8 mg/day for men and 18 mg/day for women, highlighting its importance in preventing anemia and supporting metabolic processes.
Zinc
Zinc is an essential trace mineral that serves structural and catalytic roles in over 300 enzymes. It is vital for immune function, wound healing, and DNA synthesis. Rich sources of zinc include shellfish, red meat, legumes, seeds, and nuts. The RDA for zinc for adults is 10 mg/day, emphasizing its role in cellular metabolism and overall health.
Copper
Copper is an essential trace mineral important for iron metabolism, the formation of connective tissue, and the functioning of several enzymes. It is found in organ meats, nuts, seeds, chocolate, and shellfish. The RDA for copper for adults is 1 mg/day, which is necessary for the synthesis of enzymes involved in antioxidant defense and energy production.
Iodine
Iodine is a trace mineral essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism. Iodine levels in foods vary based on soil content, with iodized salt serving as a significant source in areas where soil iodine is low. The adult RDA for iodine is 150 mcg/day, critical for thyroid function and overall metabolic health.
Selenium
Selenium is an essential trace mineral that forms part of selenoproteins, which play important roles in antioxidant defense and thyroid function. Selenium content in food varies with soil concentrations, with Brazil nuts being particularly rich in this mineral. The RDA for selenium for adults is 55 mcg/day, underlining its significance in protecting against oxidative stress and supporting metabolic processes.
________________


Cellular Level Digestion and Metabolism
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrate digestion initiates in the mouth with salivary amylase and continues in the small intestine. Enzymes like pancreatic amylase and brush border enzymes facilitate the breakdown of polysaccharides into monosaccharides. Notably, fiber, though indigestible by human enzymes, can be partially fermented by gut bacteria. Absorbed monosaccharides enter the bloodstream and are metabolized primarily in the liver, with glucose playing a central role in energy production and storage.
Proteins
Protein digestion starts in the stomach with pepsin and continues in the small intestine, where pancreatic enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin further break down proteins into amino acids. Absorption occurs via specialized transport mechanisms, with amino acids then utilized for protein synthesis, energy production, or converted into intermediates for metabolic pathways.
Lipids
Lipids undergo limited digestion in the mouth and stomach but are primarily emulsified by bile and digested by pancreatic lipase in the small intestine. Absorption of fatty acids and monoglycerides occurs through micelles, with subsequent transport as chylomicrons via the lymphatic system. Lipids are crucial for energy storage, cellular structure, and various metabolic processes.
Vitamins and Their Absorption
Vitamins, both water-soluble and fat-soluble, are absorbed through different mechanisms. Water-soluble vitamins are generally absorbed in the small intestine and transported freely in the blood, while fat-soluble vitamins require micelle formation for absorption and are incorporated into chylomicrons. Each vitamin plays unique roles in metabolic pathways and overall health.
In summary, essential minerals, vitamins, and macronutrients work synergistically to support various physiological functions, from energy metabolism to cellular repair. Adequate intake of these nutrients is vital for maintaining optimal health and preventing deficiencies.
Vitamin K (Phylloquinone; Menaquinone)
Absorption and Transport:
Vitamin K1 and K2 are absorbed in the small intestine, requiring the formation of micelles for effective uptake. After absorption, they are incorporated into chylomicrons and transported through the lymphatic system to the thoracic duct, eventually reaching the bloodstream. In the liver, they are incorporated into VLDLs for distribution to peripheral tissues. Cellular uptake occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the liver primarily stores vitamin K in the form of menaquinone.
Calcium
Absorption and Regulation:
Calcium is absorbed mainly through paracellular diffusion in the small intestine, with TRPV6 channels facilitating absorption when dietary intake is low. The blood transport involves free ionized calcium, protein-bound calcium, and complexed forms. The parathyroid gland regulates calcium homeostasis by releasing PTH, which increases calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, stimulates bone resorption, and enhances intestinal absorption via calcitriol. In contrast, calcitonin is released during high calcium levels to lower blood calcium by inhibiting bone resorption.
Magnesium
Absorption and Regulation:
Magnesium absorption occurs via both paracellular diffusion and active transport mechanisms in the small intestine. The kidneys play a critical role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis, with a significant proportion of filtered magnesium being reabsorbed. Magnesium is predominantly stored in bones and muscle tissues, with minimal amounts found in extracellular fluid.
Phosphorus
Absorption and Homeostasis:
Phosphorus is absorbed in the small intestine through both active transport and paracellular diffusion. The kidneys are crucial for phosphorus homeostasis, with a high percentage reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate. Bone resorption can also regulate phosphorus levels, particularly under the influence of PTH and calcitriol.
Sodium
Absorption and Regulation:
Sodium absorption occurs in the small intestine via the sodium-glucose cotransporter. After absorption, sodium is transported into the bloodstream through the sodium-potassium pump. The kidneys maintain sodium balance, with significant amounts found in extracellular fluid and skeletal tissue.
Potassium
Absorption and Homeostasis:
Potassium is absorbed primarily in the small intestine via passive transport mechanisms. The kidneys are responsible for regulating potassium levels, with most dietary potassium excreted in urine.
Chloride
Absorption and Regulation:
Chloride absorption occurs through passive transport and specific ion exchangers in the small intestine. The kidneys play a key role in chloride balance, reabsorbing the majority of chloride from filtered blood.
Iron
Absorption and Utilization:
Iron exists in heme and nonheme forms, with nonheme being less bioavailable. The absorption of iron occurs mainly in the duodenum, requiring reduction from ferric to ferrous form for uptake via DMT1. Iron is transported in circulation bound to transferrin and stored in the liver as ferritin. The body lacks a dedicated excretory system for iron, resulting in losses primarily through sloughed epithelial cells and bleeding.
Zinc
Absorption and Transport:
Zinc is absorbed through the small intestine via specific transporters, with ZIP4 mediating uptake and ZNT1 facilitating release into circulation. Zinc is primarily bound to albumin in the bloodstream and is excreted mainly through feces.
Copper
Absorption and Distribution:
Copper absorption occurs in the small intestine, with uptake mediated by CTR1. Once in circulation, copper binds to ceruloplasmin and is taken up by the liver. Copper transport throughout the body is facilitated by metallochaperones, and excess is excreted in bile.
Iodine
Absorption and Storage:
Iodine is absorbed efficiently in the stomach and small intestine, primarily as iodide. The thyroid gland is the main site for iodine uptake, where it is utilized for hormone synthesis, with excretion occurring mainly via urine.
Selenium
Absorption and Transport:
Selenium absorption varies based on its form, with inorganic selenium absorbed through active transport or passive diffusion. It circulates in various forms, including selenoprotein P, and is stored mainly as selenomethionine in tissues. Excretion occurs primarily through urine.
Carbohydrates
Structure and Types:
Carbohydrates are classified based on their structure into sugars, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. They serve as a primary energy source, with digestible forms such as starches and non-digestible forms like cellulose playing key roles in metabolism and gut health.
Proteins
Composition and Structure:
Proteins are composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Essential amino acids must be obtained from diet, while non-essential amino acids can be synthesized by the body. Proteins exhibit multiple structural levels, influencing their function and biological activities, essential for growth, repair, and metabolic processes.
Lipids
Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic organic molecules essential for various biological functions. They primarily exist as triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids. Fatty acids are categorized into two main types: saturated (no carbon-carbon double bonds) and unsaturated (one or more double bonds). Saturated fatty acids have higher melting points, making them solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fatty acids are typically liquid.
Triglycerides consist of a glycerol backbone bonded to three fatty acids and serve as a major energy storage form. Phospholipids contain a phosphate group attached to a glycerol and two fatty acids, forming a bilayer in cell membranes. Cholesterol, a sterol with a hydrocarbon ring structure, plays critical roles in membrane fluidity and serves as a precursor for steroid hormones.

Breaking Down Food: A Closer Look at What You Eat
Food provides essential energy and nutrients for your health, including macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). A balanced diet ensures you receive all the necessary nutrients.
Dietary Guidelines for Americans
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide evidence-based recommendations for a balanced diet, updated every five years to reflect new scientific findings. These guidelines help personalize nutritional advice to optimize health.
Finding Nutritious Foods
Macronutrients
Macronutrients supply the majority of your daily calories and are vital for energy and cellular functions, including disease resistance.
* Proteins: Critical for building muscles, skin, and organs. They provide a sensation of fullness and can be used for energy, though they are not the body's preferred energy source.
* Carbohydrates: The main fuel source, converted into glucose. There are three types:
   * Simple Carbohydrates: Quick-digesting sugars.
   * Complex Carbohydrates: Larger sugar chains that take longer to digest.
   * Fiber: Important for gut health and can help manage weight.
Micronutrients
Micronutrients are required in smaller amounts but are crucial for development and disease prevention.
Meeting Your Body’s Needs
While your body may function without sufficient macronutrients, optimal health requires them.
* Protein: Broken down into amino acids for various bodily functions.
* Carbohydrates: Provide immediate energy, primarily in the form of glucose.
Fiber and Health
Most Americans fall short of the recommended 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories. High-fiber diets can improve gut health and lower blood fat and cholesterol, reducing risks for heart disease and diabetes.
Fats
Fats, broken down into fatty acids, are necessary for energy, cellular structure, vitamin absorption, and organ protection. However, limit saturated fats to less than 10% of daily calories, focusing instead on healthy fats from nuts, seeds, and fish.
Conclusion
Maintaining a balanced diet involves mindful choices about macronutrients and micronutrients, ensuring your body receives the energy and nutrients it needs while preventing health issues related to excess intake or nutrient deficiencies.

Effect of Obesogenic Medications on Weight-Loss Outcomes in a Behavioral Weight-Management Program
________________


Objective:
The goal of this study is to evaluate whether the use of obesogenic medications affects weight loss outcomes in patients participating in the MOVE! behavioral weight loss program offered by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The study investigates if the presence of these medications reduces the likelihood of patients achieving clinically meaningful weight loss (≥5% of total body weight) during the program.
________________


Study Design:
This is a retrospective, case-control study conducted at a single center within the VHA system, involving 666 adult patients. The patients were divided into two groups based on their response to the weight-loss program:
* Responders: Patients who achieved at least a 5% reduction in total body weight by the end of the MOVE! program (n = 150).
* Non-Responders: Patients who lost less than 5% of their total body weight by the end of the program (n = 516).
________________


Methods:
The cohort consisted of veterans who participated in the MOVE! program from 2011 to 2015. Patients were referred by their primary care providers or other healthcare providers if they had a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 and were recommended for weight loss. The MOVE! program consisted of weekly 90-minute group sessions focused on behavioral modification techniques, exercise, and nutrition education.
Data on the patients’ use of obesogenic medications were collected from VHA electronic medical records. These medications were categorized based on the potential for weight gain as identified in Endocrine Society Guidelines and prior literature. The study assessed whether taking one or more obesogenic medications affected the likelihood of patients achieving a 5% total weight loss during the program.
________________


MOVE! Program Overview:
The MOVE! program is a comprehensive, evidence-based behavioral weight management program designed to help veterans lose weight through lifestyle changes. The program focuses on diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy, using group classes led by licensed professionals. The sessions include education on the benefits of weight loss, goal setting, self-monitoring, mindful eating, portion control, and overcoming barriers to physical activity. Participants are encouraged to maintain food logs, which are reviewed by the program providers, and use pedometers to track their daily activity.
________________


Study Population and Measurements:
The study population was divided based on weight loss outcomes:
* Responders: Achieved ≥5% total weight loss.
* Non-Responders: Achieved <5% total weight loss.
This 5% threshold was selected because it has been associated with clinically meaningful health improvements such as better blood pressure, glycemic control, and lipid profiles. Secondary outcomes included the number of obesogenic medications prescribed and the effects of specific medication classes (e.g., antidiabetics, beta-blockers, antidepressants) on achieving 5% total weight loss.
Data on obesogenic medications, comorbidities, and demographics were manually abstracted from electronic health records. Medications were categorized as either obesogenic (known to cause a weight gain of ≥2 kg or ≥5% of baseline weight) or leptogenic (known to cause weight loss). Obesity pharmacotherapy drugs approved for treating obesity were also documented. Outpatient prescriptions of at least one month in duration, filled through VHA pharmacies, were considered as medication use. Prescriptions not filled by the VA were identified through primary care notes.
________________


Obesogenic Medications:
The study identified various classes of obesogenic medications commonly prescribed to veterans. These medications can contribute to weight gain through different mechanisms, including stimulating appetite, reducing energy expenditure, and promoting water retention. The primary obesogenic medications observed in the cohort are listed below:
Medication Class
	Obesogenic Medications
	Mechanism of Weight Gain
	Anticonvulsants (n=89)
	Gabapentin (72), Pregabalin (12), Carbamazepine (3), Valproic Acid (2)
	Increase appetite, decrease energy expenditure
	Antidepressants/Antianxiety (n=85)
	Fluoxetine (33), Mirtazapine (18), Amitriptyline (19), Paroxetine (10), Nortriptyline (5)
	Stimulate appetite via serotonergic pathways
	Antihistamines (n=125)
	Loratadine (47), Cetirizine (29), Hydroxyzine (29), Diphenhydramine (18), Fexofenadine (2)
	Increase appetite, alter body weight regulation
	Antipsychotics (n=36)
	Quetiapine (17), Risperidone (11), Olanzapine (5), Ziprasidone (3)
	Alter neuropeptide expression, stimulate orexigenic signals
	Beta-Blockers (n=205)
	Atenolol (80), Metoprolol (79), Carvedilol (24), Propanolol (22)
	Reduce energy expenditure, inhibit lipolysis
	Corticosteroids/Hormones (n=15)
	Prednisone (11), Medroxyprogesterone (2), Oral Contraceptives (2)
	Alter energy balance, increase appetite
	Diabetes Medications (n=156)
	Insulin (70), Sulfonylureas (58), Thiazolidinediones (28)
	Promote fat storage, increase water retention
	The study observed that patients who were prescribed three or more obesogenic medications had the greatest difficulty achieving 5% weight loss.
________________


Results:
* Approximately 62% of the participants (n = 411) were taking at least one obesogenic medication.
* Patients on obesogenic medications were 37% less likely to achieve 5% weight loss compared to those not taking such medications (Odds Ratio 0.633; 95% CI, 0.427–0.937; adjusted P = 0.022).
* The effect was more pronounced in patients prescribed three or more obesogenic medications, who were 73% less likely to achieve 5% weight loss (Odds Ratio 0.265; 95% CI, 0.108–0.646; adjusted P = 0.003).
________________


Conclusions:
The study concluded that the use of provider-prescribed obesogenic medications is associated with worse weight loss outcomes in the MOVE! behavioral weight loss program. This suggests that closer scrutiny of medications that may cause weight gain is necessary to improve the success of weight management interventions. Healthcare providers should consider adjusting or replacing obesogenic medications to enhance the effectiveness of weight-loss treatments in patients undergoing behavioral therapy.

Introduction:
Obesity is a growing public health crisis, with projections indicating that 51% of the U.S. population will be obese by 2030. Veterans are disproportionately affected by obesity, with nearly 78% of veterans classified as overweight or obese. Obesity leads to increased healthcare costs, with an estimated additional annual cost of $1429 per person with obesity.
The MOVE! program, established by the VHA in 2005, is a comprehensive weight management program designed to address obesity in veterans. Despite the program’s structured approach, outcomes vary, with only 18-20% of participants achieving clinically meaningful weight loss. Understanding the factors that influence these outcomes, including the potential impact of obesogenic medications, is critical for improving the success rates of weight-loss programs.
Medications known to cause weight gain are prescribed for a variety of conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, depression, and chronic pain. These medications may contribute to weight gain through mechanisms such as increased appetite, reduced physical activity, or metabolic changes. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend avoiding obesogenic medications in patients with overweight or obesity when possible.
________________


Significance:
This study highlights the importance of considering the impact of medications on weight loss outcomes. With the growing prevalence of obesity, especially among veterans, understanding how obesogenic medications affect weight loss can guide more effective treatment strategies. By addressing medication-related barriers, healthcare providers can help improve the success rates of behavioral weight-loss programs like MOVE!.
________________


Challenges:
* Medication-induced weight gain: Many commonly prescribed medications have side effects that counteract the effects of behavioral interventions aimed at weight loss.
* Heterogeneous patient populations: Veterans may have multiple comorbidities requiring complex medication regimens, making it challenging to alter or eliminate obesogenic drugs.
* Adherence to the program: Some patients may struggle to adhere to the program’s requirements, including attending sessions and following dietary or physical activity recommendations.
________________


Recommendations:
* Medication Review: Healthcare providers should regularly assess the medications prescribed to patients enrolled in weight-loss programs and consider alternative treatments that do not promote weight gain.
* Tailored Interventions: Weight management plans should be individualized, taking into account the patient’s medication profile, comorbidities, and specific challenges.
* Multi-disciplinary Approach: Collaboration between primary care providers, pharmacists, and weight management specialists is essential to optimize treatment and enhance weight-loss outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
We performed statistical comparisons between responders (achieved ≥5% total weight loss [TWL]) and non-responders using two-sample t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regressions controlled for potential confounders like age, gender, body mass index (BMI), obesogenic medications (prescribed for at least one month during the 8-week intervention), leptogenic medications, and obesity pharmacotherapy.

Results
Patient Characteristics
Our cohort consisted of 666 participants, of which 150 (22.5%) achieved 5%TWL by the end of the MOVE! program, classifying them as responders. The remaining 516 participants (77.5%) did not reach this threshold and were considered non-responders.
Responders were significantly older (63.0 ± 0.8 vs. 59.4 ± 0.5 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to be male (P = 0.025) compared to non-responders. Responders had higher excess weight loss (27.1 ± 2.0% vs. 3.0 ± 0.5%, P < 0.001) and total weight loss (TWL) (7.9 ± 0.5% vs. 0.8 ± 0.1%, P < 0.001).
Weight Loss and Obesogenic Medications
A notable finding was that 61.7% of participants were prescribed obesogenic medications. These medications were prescribed less frequently among responders compared to non-responders (54% vs. 64%, P = 0.029), suggesting an association between these medications and lower likelihood of achieving meaningful weight loss. Patients taking obesogenic medications were 37% less likely to achieve ≥5%TWL (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.633, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.427–0.937, P = 0.022).
Effect of Multiple Obesogenic Medications
We further analyzed the effect of the number of obesogenic medications prescribed. Patients taking three or more obesogenic medications were the least likely to achieve 5%TWL (adjusted OR 0.265, 95% CI 0.108–0.646, P = 0.003). These patients also had the lowest absolute weight loss by the end of the program (2.90 ± 1.32 pounds), compared to those taking no obesogenic medications (7.30 ± 0.66 pounds).
Obesogenic Medication Classes
Different classes of obesogenic drugs, especially antidiabetic medications, were associated with lower odds of achieving 5%TWL (adjusted OR 0.387, 95% CI 0.207–0.723, P = 0.003). This suggests that the specific class of medication influences weight loss outcomes.
Comorbidities and Weight Loss
We evaluated the influence of comorbidities on weight loss outcomes. No significant differences were found between responders and non-responders in comorbid conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and type 2 diabetes. However, for patients taking obesogenic medications, weight loss outcomes were inferior, regardless of comorbidity presence.
________________


Discussion
Our analysis reveals that patients prescribed obesogenic medications during the 8-week MOVE! behavioral weight loss program were 37% less likely to achieve ≥5%TWL. This finding aligns with prior studies indicating that obesogenic medications negatively affect weight loss outcomes, even after surgical interventions like laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Specifically, patients on obesogenic medications had significantly less excess weight loss post-surgery (53.8% vs. 65%, P = 0.002).
The negative impact of obesogenic medications was more pronounced with an increasing number of medications, especially for those taking three or more obesogenic drugs. This suggests a dose-response relationship between the number of obesogenic medications and poor weight loss outcomes.
Despite concerns about comorbidities influencing weight loss, our results show no significant association between comorbid conditions and weight loss outcomes among patients using obesogenic medications. The poorer outcomes for those on obesogenic medications persisted even when controlling for baseline characteristics, indicating that medication usage is an independent predictor of weight loss failure.
The variability in weight loss outcomes across different treatment modalities, whether behavioral or surgical, underscores the importance of addressing obesogenic medications in weight management strategies. For healthcare providers, reducing or substituting obesogenic medications may significantly improve weight loss outcomes in patients undergoing behavioral interventions like the MOVE! program.
Our findings align with the 2015 clinical practice guidelines by the Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, and the Obesity Society, recommending leptogenic and weight-neutral medications for managing obesity in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus. Identifying obesogenic medications during each clinical encounter is vital. We observed that patients on antihistamines, antidiabetic, and antipsychotic medications had significantly lower odds of achieving a 5% total weight loss (TWL).
The obesogenic mechanism's role in the obesity epidemic requires further exploration, and developing alternative medications could significantly enhance weight loss efforts. Antidiabetic drugs, for instance, accounted for 11.8% of total U.S. prescriptions in 2012, highlighting the challenge in minimizing their use. In fact, guidelines suggest favoring weight-neutral options, such as metformin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, over obesogenic medications like insulin. A notable study demonstrated that patients on metformin experienced significantly more weight loss than those on a placebo (2.1 kg vs 0.1 kg, P < 0.001).
Addressing the use of obesogenic medications requires a multidisciplinary approach to avoid exacerbating the controlled disease or creating additional costs. For example, while newer alternatives like pramlintide may cost up to $250 monthly compared to $20-$30 for glipizide, the long-term health benefits of weight loss may justify the expense. Similar to past efforts in antibiotic prescription reform, safe obesogenic prescription practices could be established through education, policy updates, and feedback from healthcare providers.
While published effects of obesogenic medications on weight may seem modest, their cumulative impact is significant and may obstruct weight loss efforts. Therefore, minimizing such obstacles is crucial.
Limitations
Our retrospective study design comes with several limitations, including potential unknown confounders, adherence issues, and a cohort restricted to VHA patients. Additionally, we could not assess over-the-counter drug use, which could have affected weight loss. Moreover, the exclusion of patients who dropped out of the MOVE! program could have skewed results toward those more successful in weight loss efforts. However, this does not diminish the significant relationship between obesogenic medication use and poor weight loss outcomes in our cohort, which was predominantly older Caucasian men. Future research should include a more diverse population and a prospective study design, potentially randomizing patients to continue or discontinue obesogenic medications during a weight loss program.
Conclusions
Despite increased awareness of medication-induced weight gain, obesogenic medications remain commonly prescribed to patients attempting to lose weight. Our retrospective study demonstrates that the use of these medications significantly reduces the likelihood of achieving meaningful weight loss, particularly in patients using antidiabetic drugs. As the number of obesogenic medications prescribed increases, weight loss outcomes worsen. Enhancing prescription practices by prioritizing weight-neutral or leptogenic medications may help improve the weight loss outcomes for patients in behavioral weight loss programs.
