Adult BMI Categories
Overview
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body weight relative to height, calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of height (in meters). For adults, BMI categories include underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obesity, which is divided into three classes. BMI serves as a screening tool and should be evaluated alongside other health factors.
BMI Categories for Adults (Ages 20 and Older)
* Underweight: BMI < 18.5
* Healthy Weight: BMI 18.5 to < 25
* Overweight: BMI 25 to < 30
* Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
   * Class 1 Obesity: BMI 30 to < 35
   * Class 2 Obesity: BMI 35 to < 40
   * Class 3 Obesity (Severe Obesity): BMI ≥ 40
Important Note
BMI is a useful screening measure, but it should be considered in conjunction with other health indicators. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized insights.
Example: BMI for an Adult (5'9" Tall)
Weight Range

Child and Teen BMI Categories
Overview
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body weight relative to height. For children and teens, BMI values are compared to others of the same sex and age, resulting in BMI-for-age percentiles. The categories for children and teens include underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obesity, and severe obesity.
BMI Categories for Children and Teens (Ages 2 to 19)
* Underweight: Less than the 5th percentile
* Healthy Weight: 5th percentile to < 85th percentile
* Overweight: 85th percentile to < 95th percentile
* Obesity: 95th percentile or greater
* Severe Obesity: 120% of the 95th percentile or greater, or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²
Expanded Definition of Severe Obesity (American Academy of Pediatrics)
* Class 2 Obesity: 120% to < 140% of the 95th percentile, or BMI 35 to < 40 kg/m²
* Class 3 Obesity: 140% of the 95th percentile or greater, or BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²
Understanding Percentiles
Percentiles indicate how an individual's BMI compares to a reference population. For example, a 12-year-old girl who is 5 feet tall and weighs 136 pounds has a BMI of 26.6, which places her at the 96th percentile—meaning her BMI is equal to or higher than 96% of her peers.
Additional Information
* Child BMI Percentiles: These percentiles help assess a child's growth patterns compared to others of the same sex and age.
* BMI Calculator: The CDC provides a Child and Teen BMI Calculator that:
   * Calculates BMI and BMI percentile.
   * Displays results on a growth chart with explanations.
   * Offers links to additional resources.
   * Is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
Accurate Measurement
Accurate height and weight measurements are crucial for calculating BMI and percentiles. Follow proper procedures to ensure precise results.

BMI as a Measure
Definition
Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters).
Formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)²
Association with Body Fat
While BMI does not directly measure body fat, it is moderately to strongly correlated with other body fat measures, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which provides precise body composition data. However, DEXA scans are expensive and less accessible.
Advantages of BMI
* Quick and easy to calculate
* Inexpensive and noninvasive
* Can be collected during routine healthcare visits
Limitations
BMI does not differentiate between fat, muscle, and bone mass, nor does it indicate the type or distribution of body fat.
BMI for Screening
BMI serves as a reliable screening tool to assess weight relative to height. Certain BMI categories are linked to health issues; for instance, a BMI in the obesity category can indicate increased risk for conditions like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Routine tracking of BMI is beneficial for detecting weight changes and monitoring health risks. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual BMI assessments for children starting at age 2.
BMI for Population Health
BMI is an essential population health measure, used globally to assess trends and comparisons over time and across various demographics. For example, the CDC’s Adult Obesity Maps visualize obesity rates by state and demographic factors, aiding public health decision-making. BMI data from programs like WIC help track obesity trends among young children.
BMI for Individual Health
BMI can assist individuals and healthcare providers in evaluating chronic disease risk. To gain a comprehensive understanding of health, consider BMI alongside other factors, including:
* Medical history (existing conditions and family history)
* Health behaviors (diet, physical activity, sleep)
* Physical exam results (blood pressure, muscle mass)
* Laboratory findings (glucose and cholesterol levels)

Calculate your body mass index (BMI) for adults
Use this service to:
* check the BMI of an adult aged 18 and over
* get information about what to do next
You should not use this tool to diagnose any symptoms. If you are worried about your weight, contact your local pharmacist or GP surgery.
Who should not use this tool
You should not use this tool if you, or the person you're using it for:
* are under 18 years old
* are pregnant
* have been diagnosed with an eating disorder, or think you may have one
* have a condition that affects your height
Information:
If you or your child are aged between 2 and 17, calculate BMI for children and teenagers.
What you will need
To use the calculator, you will need to know your:
* height
* weight
Ethnic background
The calculator will also ask for information on your ethnic background.
This is because people from an Asian, Black African, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern ethnic background have a higher chance of developing health problems at a lower BMI.
When you enter information on your ethnic background, the calculator will give you more accurate advice about your BMI result.
Your result
Your BMI result will be displayed as a number with one of these weight categories:
* underweight
* a healthy weight
* overweight
* obese
After getting your result, you may be asked to measure your waist. This can help you understand if you are carrying too much weight around your tummy.
How your BMI is calculated
The BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.
For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.70m (around 5 foot 7 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by:
1. squaring your height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89
2. dividing your weight in kilograms: 70 ÷ 2.89 = 24.22
Your result will be displayed to one decimal place, for example, 24.2.
What your result means
A higher BMI increases the chance of developing long-term conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
The BMI calculation is just one measure of health. It cannot tell the difference between muscle and fat.
For example, if you have a lot of muscle, you may be classed as overweight or obese despite having low body fat.
This is why you may get a better idea of your overall health from measuring your waist.

Nutrition as We Age: Healthy Eating with the Dietary Guidelines
Overview
Good nutrition throughout life is crucial for preventing chronic diseases. Older adults face higher risks for conditions like heart disease and osteoporosis, but they can reduce these risks by consuming nutrient-dense foods and staying active. Although their calorie needs may decrease, nutrient requirements often remain the same or even increase due to factors like reduced physical activity and age-related changes.
Special Considerations for Older Adults
The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) assesses diet quality based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Older adults score an average of 63 out of 100, indicating potential for improvement. Emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy while reducing added sugars and saturated fats can enhance diet quality. Protein intake is essential to prevent muscle loss; however, many older adults do not consume enough protein. Including seafood, dairy, beans, and lentils can help meet protein needs while providing vital nutrients like calcium and vitamin D.
Vitamin B12 Absorption
The ability to absorb vitamin B12 may decrease with age or certain medications. Health professionals should ensure older adults are getting enough B12 through foods like breakfast cereals and may discuss dietary supplements if necessary.
Healthy Beverage Choices
Older adults may struggle to stay hydrated due to reduced thirst perception. Encouraging water intake is important, along with options like unsweetened fruit juices and low-fat milk. If consuming alcohol, moderation is key—2 drinks or fewer for men and 1 drink or fewer for women—due to increased sensitivity to alcohol in older age.
Supporting Healthy Eating
Support from health professionals, family, and friends is vital in helping older adults adopt a healthy diet that suits their preferences and budget. Considerations include:
* Enjoyment of Food: Sharing meals can enhance enjoyment and foster connections.
* Chewing and Swallowing: Adapt cooking methods to accommodate different textures for those with chewing difficulties. Dental health is also important.
* Food Safety: Older adults are at higher risk for foodborne illnesses; safe food handling practices are crucial.

Gender Differences in Eating Behavior and Body Weight Regulation
Authors: Barbara J. Rolls, Ingrid C. Fedoroff, Joanne F. Guthrie
Affiliation: Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
Overview
Gender differences in eating behavior and body weight regulation begin in adolescence. Men generally consume more calories and exhibit different eating styles compared to women, who tend to be socialized into more restrictive eating patterns. Women experience greater food-related conflicts, such as enjoying high-calorie foods while feeling pressured not to eat them. This pressure often leads to dieting behaviors in young girls, contributing to a higher prevalence of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders among women.
Key Terms:
* Anorexia Nervosa
* Body Weight
* Bulimia Nervosa
* Eating Behavior
* Gender
* Obesity
________________


Developmental Changes
Infancy and Childhood
* Boys and girls exhibit similar eating behaviors in early childhood.
Adolescence
* Gender differences become pronounced during adolescence, driven by physiological and social changes.
* Prepubertal boys and girls are comparable in lean body mass, skeletal mass, and body fat.
* By maturity, women have approximately twice the body fat of men, while men have 1.5 times the lean body mass.
Hormonal Influences
* Post-puberty, women undergo significant hormonal fluctuations that impact food intake. Studies indicate that food intake varies with the menstrual cycle, with lower intake around ovulation (high estrogen) and higher intake during the luteal phase (low estrogen).
* Research shows a similar pattern in appetite ratings, particularly in women with premenstrual syndrome.
Male Eating Patterns
* Less research is available on how sex hormones affect male eating behaviors, but some studies suggest men may have a preference for sweeter foods.
________________


Gender Differences in Food Selection and Intake
Adolescents
* Boys typically require a higher caloric intake due to greater body weight and metabolic rates. Recommended intake is 3,000 kcal/day for boys and 2,200 kcal/day for girls aged 15-18.
* National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) data reveal that average caloric intake for males (3,048 kcal/day) exceeds that of females (1,687 kcal/day).
* Males consume more calorie-dense foods, while females often choose lower-calorie options.
Adults
* Energy needs continue to differ in adulthood, with men requiring more calories (2,900 kcal/day) compared to women (2,220 kcal/day).
* NHANES II indicates that average caloric intake remains higher for men (2,554 kcal/day) than for women (1,596 kcal/day).
* Studies show minimal differences in the nutritional quality of diets between genders when controlling for total energy intake.
Food Preferences
* Men report higher consumption of meats, dairy, and carbohydrate-rich foods, while women tend to consume more fruits, yogurt, and low-calorie beverages.
* Data from 1977-1985 show evolving food consumption patterns, with both genders becoming more health-conscious, though women still consume more low-calorie beverages than men.


Satisfaction with Body Weight and Shape
Overview
There are notable gender differences in how men and women perceive and feel about their body shape and weight. Women generally report lower satisfaction with their body shape and often perceive themselves as overweight, while many men tend to view themselves as underweight and express a desire to gain weight. This disparity extends to overall satisfaction with body weight, with men typically feeling more content with their perceived weight compared to women.
________________


Key Findings
1. Body Satisfaction:
   * Women are less satisfied with their body shape than men (Connor-Greene, 1988; Drewnowski & Yee, 1987).
   * Many women wish to be thinner than they perceive themselves to be, while men generally prefer women to be heavier than women desire (Fallon & Rozin, 1985).
2. Influence of Social Class:
   * Social class significantly impacts body image perceptions. Gender and family income are strong predictors of adolescents' desires to be thin (Dornbusch et al., 1984).
   * Higher-income girls are more likely to express a desire to lose weight, with nearly half of adolescent girls wishing to lose weight, in contrast to very few boys regardless of income.
3. Historical Context of the Ideal Female Shape:
   * Women's status has historically been more closely tied to physical appearance compared to men, increasing pressure to conform to prevailing body ideals (Mazur, 1986; Seid, 1989).
   * The ideal female body has evolved significantly over the centuries, from the voluptuous figures celebrated in art from the 16th to 19th centuries to the thin, boyish ideal of the 1920s, which emphasized a less curvaceous appearance.
4. Current Trends:
   * Today’s cultural ideal often leads women to diet in pursuit of an unrealistic body image. In a study by Schwartz, Thompson, and Johnson (1981), over 75% of women cited appearance as their primary motivation for weight loss, rather than health.
________________


Conclusion
Understanding the gender distinctions in body satisfaction and the societal pressures surrounding body image is crucial for addressing body weight concerns and promoting healthier self-perceptions among both genders. Further research can help develop effective interventions to improve body satisfaction across different demographics.
Obesity
Sex Differences in Body Fat
Overview
Women typically have a higher fat-to-lean tissue ratio than men. This results in a lower basal metabolic rate since fat is less metabolically active than lean tissue. As a result, women generally require less energy. Key life stages—adolescence, pregnancy, and menopause—are associated with increases in body fat for women, while men do not experience similar changes.
Key Points
1. Basal Metabolic Rate:
   * Women have a lower basal metabolic rate due to a higher proportion of body fat and smaller body size compared to men.
2. Life Stages:
   * Significant increases in body fat occur during:
      * Adolescence
      * Pregnancy
      * Menopause
   * Aging in women often leads to more fat accumulation as metabolic rates decrease.
3. Fat Distribution:
   * Men usually have more abdominal fat, while women tend to have more fat in the lower body.
   * Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and lactation affect fat metabolism in women.
4. Hormonal Influences:
   * In menstruating women, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity increases in the hip area, leading to fat accumulation. This is amplified during pregnancy and reversed during lactation.
5. Health Implications:
   * A higher waist-hip ratio, indicating more abdominal fat, is linked to increased risks of diabetes and cardiovascular issues.
   * Lower body fat may be less harmful, but obesity is still a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease in middle-aged women.
Conclusion
Understanding the differences in body fat distribution and associated health risks for women is crucial in addressing obesity and its health concerns effectively.
Gender and Weight Loss
Overview
Men and women in the United States respond differently to being overweight. Women are more likely to view themselves as overweight, experience greater anxiety related to their weight, and make more attempts to lose weight. Although it has been thought that men are more successful at weight loss, recent studies have challenged this notion.
Key Points
1. Perception of Weight:
   * Women are more likely to believe they are overweight and to feel anxious about it.
   * Most studies suggest a slightly higher prevalence of obesity in women compared to men.
2. Weight Loss Attempts:
   * Women make more attempts to lose weight than men.
   * A study showed that only 3% of participants maintained their weight loss after a 15-week program, with women who had early-onset obesity showing the best maintenance (Kramer et al., 1989).
3. Long-Term Maintenance:
   * Women tend to maintain weight loss better than men (Forster & Jeffery, 1986).
   * Women reported lower self-esteem and less confidence in controlling their eating compared to men.
4. Eating Responses:

Gender and Basic Nutritional Needs
Macronutrients
Foods contain three main macronutrients: protein, fat, and carbohydrates. For optimal health, adults should consume these macronutrients in specific ratios, which are consistent for both men and women:
* Protein: 10 to 35% of total calories
* Carbohydrates: 45 to 65% of total calories
* Fats: 20 to 35% of total calories
Individual Variations
Nutritional needs can vary within genders based on factors such as:
* Genetic makeup
* Body composition
* Hormonal levels
* Chronic diseases
* Medications
These factors can influence individual requirements for both macronutrients and micronutrients.
________________


Micronutrients
Micronutrients, which include vitamins and minerals, are needed in smaller amounts for good health. The FDA has established daily nutritional goals for these micronutrients.
Differences by Gender
Men generally require more calories than women, leading to higher needs for certain micronutrients. Men need more of the following:
* Magnesium
* Potassium
* Zinc
* Vitamin A
* Vitamin C
* Thiamin
* Riboflavin
* Niacin
* Choline
* Vitamin K
* Vitamin B-6 (after age 70)
Shared Nutritional Goals
Some daily nutritional goals are the same for both males and females, including:
* Phosphorus
* Sodium
* Vitamin E
* Vitamin D
* Vitamin B-12
* Folate
________________


Conclusion
Understanding the macronutrient and micronutrient needs based on gender and individual factors is essential for achieving optimal health. Proper dietary planning should consider these variations to ensure all nutritional needs are met.
Micronutrients and Female Reproductive Cycles
Overview
Women’s micronutrient needs can vary significantly due to reproductive functions. Specific micronutrients are crucial for women during different life stages, particularly during reproductive years and after menopause.
Key Micronutrient Needs
1. Iron:
   * Women need more than twice the amount of iron as men during their reproductive years.
   * After age 50, iron needs equalize between men and women.
2. Calcium:
   * Women's daily calcium intake requirement increases at age 51 to support bone health after menopause.
   * Men's calcium needs increase later, at age 71.
3. Pregnancy and Lactation:
   * Pregnant and lactating women have higher requirements for:
      * Folate
      * Iodine
      * Choline
      * Iron
Folic Acid Recommendation
Medical experts advise women who can become pregnant to take folic acid supplements, even if they are not planning a pregnancy. Adequate folate is essential to prevent neural tube defects, making it important during the month before conception and throughout the first trimester.

Do Food Choices Differ by Gender?
Food Preferences
Studies indicate that men and women often have different food preferences, impacting their nutritional intake.
Food Choices
* A study of young adults found that:
   * Women consumed more whole grains, cereals, and cooked vegetables.
   * Women ate fewer eggs, meat, and processed meats.
Meat Consumption
* Research shows men tend to eat more meat and have a more positive view of it, linking meat consumption with masculinity.
* Women are more likely than men to adopt vegetarian or vegan diets.
Plant-Based Diets
* A Yale study found women are generally more open than men to adopting plant-based diets, motivated by health, environmental concerns, and animal welfare.
________________


Are Women Healthier Eaters?
Healthy Eating Habits
Research suggests that women tend to be more knowledgeable about nutrition and often make healthier dietary choices.
Healthy Eating Behaviors
* A survey across 23 countries revealed that women are more likely than men to:
   * Avoid high-fat foods
   * Consume fruits
   * Add fiber-rich foods
   * Limit salt intake
Food Avoidance
* A Swedish study found women often avoid foods perceived as unhealthy, including:
   * Gluten
   * Red meat
   * White flour
   * Preservatives
   * Food coloring
Dieting Trends
* Women in the Swedish study were found to be more likely to be dieting than men. However, the motivation for making healthy choices often outweighed the reasons for dieting.
________________


Conclusion
Women’s nutritional needs, especially regarding micronutrients, are influenced by reproductive functions and life stages. Additionally, food choices and eating habits differ between genders, with women generally exhibiting healthier eating patterns and a greater awareness of nutrition.

Title
Differences in Weight Loss Outcomes for Males and Females on a Low-Carbohydrate Diet: A Systematic Review
Authors
Alyssa Susanto¹, Jessica Burk¹, Samantha Hocking¹ ², Tania Markovic¹ ², Tim Gill¹
Abstract
Weight loss responses vary among individuals, with some factors, including gender, influencing outcomes. This review systematically examines weight change differences between males and females on low-carbohydrate diets. While most studies report no significant gender differences, those that do find that males tend to lose more weight than females. Few trials stratify data by gender, an important consideration given physiological and psychological differences between genders that may affect weight loss outcomes. Tailored weight loss strategies considering gender could improve overall success in weight management.
Keywords
Low-carbohydrate diet, Weight loss, Obesity, Gender differences, Tailoring, Demographics
Introduction
Obesity rates have tripled since 1975, becoming a global health concern. Most weight loss studies report average outcomes, overlooking individual variability. Factors such as compliance, compensatory behaviors, and hormonal differences contribute to this variability. Tailoring weight loss advice based on demographics such as age, gender, and psychosocial factors enhances long-term success. Research suggests males may respond better to low-carbohydrate diets than females, yet few studies focus on gender differences in these interventions. This review explores weight loss variations by gender in low-carbohydrate diet trials.
Methods
Eligibility Criteria
This review includes clinical trials on low-carbohydrate diets targeting weight loss in adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) that analyze gender differences. Trials that included children, only one gender, or pharmacological interventions were excluded.
Search Strategy
Three databases—Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials—were searched from 1985 to 2019. Search terms included ‘weight loss,’ ‘obesity,’ ‘overweight,’ ‘low-carbohydrate,’ ‘gender,’ and ‘clinical trial.’ Screening and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer.
Results
The majority of studies reported no significant gender difference in weight loss outcomes. However, when differences were found, males typically lost more weight than females. Males tend to be underrepresented in weight loss trials, making up only 27% of participants. Biological factors such as body composition and hormonal differences, along with social factors like motivation and body image concerns, contribute to gender-based variations in weight loss outcomes.
Discussion
Weight loss outcomes are influenced by gender-specific physiological and psychological factors. Males, due to differences in metabolism, fat distribution, and muscle mass, may achieve faster short-term weight loss than females on low-carbohydrate diets. Tailoring interventions by gender could enhance the effectiveness of weight loss strategies. However, the lack of gender-specific data in trials highlights the need for more research in this area.
Conclusion
This review demonstrates that males often lose more weight than females on low-carbohydrate diets, although not all studies report significant differences. Future research should focus on gender-specific weight loss interventions to provide more personalized and effective treatment plans for obesity.

Introduction
In recent decades, global changes in nutritional patterns and increased sedentary behavior have contributed to a worldwide epidemic termed ‘diabesity,’ a condition in which obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) coexist. This issue is particularly relevant in Oman, where T2DM cases are increasing by approximately 7000 per year, bringing the total number to around 98,000 cases. For adults with T2DM, adherence to self-care routines—including dietary restrictions, physical exercise, medication, and glucose monitoring—is critical for achieving sustained glycemic control and favorable long-term health outcomes.
Dietary adherence is especially challenging for patients with T2DM. Unlike medication adherence, which involves fewer and more straightforward actions, dietary changes require consistent effort throughout the day. Furthermore, three specific challenges complicate diet adherence in T2DM patients:
1. Customized diets based on individual patient characteristics.
2. Conflicting dietary recommendations from various health authorities.
3. Evolving nutritional science, which may cause confusion and reduce patients’ resolve to adhere to dietary plans.
Only about 25% of T2DM patients adhere to their prescribed dietary plans, highlighting the importance of developing effective strategies for improving adherence. This literature review aims to define diet adherence for healthcare providers and identify key barriers to diet adherence in T2DM patients.
Definitions and Conceptual Background
In healthcare literature, the terms "adherence," "compliance," "concordance," and "sustenance" are often used interchangeably. The term "adherence" gained popularity in the mid-1990s, replacing the term "compliance," as it is perceived as less judgmental and more reflective of a mutual responsibility between the patient and healthcare provider. Adherence is frequently used in combination with other terms, such as "medication adherence," "exercise adherence," and "diet adherence."
Adherence to a diabetic diet, the cornerstone of T2DM management, involves individualized dietary recommendations given within a medical context. A healthy diet typically includes at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, with limited intake of free sugars and fats. Despite its proven benefits, dietary adherence remains low among T2DM patients. For example, in the US, only 28% of people with diabetes meet the recommended guidelines for saturated fat, and adherence rates are similarly low in other regions, such as Jordan and New Zealand.
Methods
The Walker and Avant method of concept analysis was employed to clarify the meaning of diet adherence, its attributes, antecedents, and consequences. The analysis involved a comprehensive literature search of English-language studies published between 2010 and 2020. Scientific databases, such as CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and others, were searched using keywords including "diet adherence," "compliance," and "T2DM." The search yielded a range of studies, which were evaluated for inclusion based on their focus on defining attributes, antecedents, consequences, and measurement of diet adherence.
Results
Definition of Diet Adherence
Adherence, according to the Cambridge English Dictionary, is the act of following rules or guidelines strictly. When combined with "diet," it refers to faithfully following dietary recommendations, usually agreed upon by both the patient and healthcare provider. In T2DM patients, these dietary recommendations must be tailored to the individual, taking into account their disease stage, biochemical parameters, and available food options.
The World Health Organization defines adherence as the degree to which a person's behavior, including dietary habits, aligns with healthcare recommendations. Self-efficacy and family support are crucial for maintaining dietary adherence, with social and economic factors playing a significant role.
Key Attributes of Diet Adherence
Three critical attributes of diet adherence were identified:
1. Following Recommendations: The first step in dietary adherence is understanding and implementing dietary recommendations. This involves changing negative thoughts into positive internal dialogues and learning new skills to adopt healthier behaviors.
2. Self-Monitoring: Self-monitoring involves awareness and recording of dietary intake, which can include calories, macronutrients, or portion sizes. This process helps patients improve their self-management and has been linked to successful weight loss.
3. Maintenance and Relapse Prevention: Maintaining dietary changes over the long term is essential but challenging. Factors such as stress or social events may lead to relapses. Strategies for relapse prevention are necessary to help patients sustain dietary adherence.
Antecedents of Diet Adherence
Several antecedents must precede the behavior change required for successful diet adherence:
* Motivation: Motivation is critical in initiating and maintaining adherence. It mobilizes personal resources and is closely linked to improved clinical outcomes, such as lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.
* Understanding Recommendations: Patients must fully understand dietary recommendations to adhere to them. Studies have shown that a better understanding leads to higher adherence.
* Self-Efficacy: The belief in one's ability to follow a prescribed diet is a significant predictor of long-term success.
* Goal Setting: Setting specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) goals can help improve dietary adherence.
* Social Support: Family and social support play a crucial role in helping individuals maintain dietary changes, particularly when it comes to meal planning and grocery shopping.
Consequences of Diet Adherence
Adhering to a prescribed diet offers numerous benefits, including:
* Clinical Improvements: Better control of body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
* Psychological Benefits: Increased self-esteem, confidence, and overall health-related quality of life.
Conclusion
This concept analysis clarified the definition of diet adherence in T2DM patients, highlighting the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of adherence. Understanding these components can help healthcare providers develop better strategies and interventions to support patients in adhering to their dietary plans.

. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.22815
Publication Date: July 18, 2024
Key Points
Question: What is the link between a healthy prenatal dietary pattern and autism diagnosis or autism-related traits in children, based on two large cohort studies, MoBa (Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study) and ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children)?
Findings: Maternal consumption of a healthy prenatal diet was associated with reduced odds of offspring autism diagnosis (MoBa) and fewer social communication difficulties (MoBa and ALSPAC). No consistent associations were found for other autism traits.
Meaning: Prenatal diet may play a role in autism-related outcomes and contribute to understanding autism's causes.
Abstract
Objective: Investigate the relationship between prenatal dietary patterns and autism diagnosis/autism-associated traits using large cohort studies from Norway and the UK.
Design: Cohort study using data from MoBa (84,548 mother-infant pairs) and ALSPAC (11,760 mother-infant pairs). Data from FFQs (food frequency questionnaires) were analyzed, and children were followed up to age 8.
Main Outcomes: Odds of autism diagnosis and social communication difficulties in children were compared across levels of adherence to a healthy prenatal dietary pattern.
Introduction
Autism diagnosis and autism-associated traits vary across the population, and social communication difficulties and restrictive behaviors are two key features.
Prenatal dietary patterns are a potential factor in autism development, but existing studies have been small and inconsistent.
Objective: To examine the link between a healthy prenatal diet and autism/autism-related traits in large populations (MoBa and ALSPAC).
Methods
Study Design: Data from two cohort studies (MoBa in Norway and ALSPAC in the UK) were used. Participants completed FFQs to report dietary patterns during pregnancy.
Population: MoBa involved 84,548 pregnancies, and ALSPAC involved 11,760 pregnancies. Both cohorts tracked autism diagnoses and autism-associated traits (like social communication difficulties) up to age 8.
Dietary Pattern: A healthy prenatal diet was defined through factor analysis and included high consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and whole grains, and low consumption of red/processed meat and sugary foods.
Outcome Measures:
Autism Diagnosis: Collected from hospital records and diagnostic criteria (ICD-10 codes) in MoBa.
Social Communication Difficulties: Measured using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) in MoBa and the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (SCDC) in ALSPAC.
Statistical Analysis
Confounders: Maternal age, education, depression, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, multivitamin use, and planned pregnancy were considered.
Models: Odds ratios were calculated for each outcome (autism diagnosis, SCQ, SCDC) by comparing high, medium, and low adherence to a healthy diet. Sensitivity analyses tested robustness by adjusting for additional factors.
Results
Main Findings:
High adherence to a healthy prenatal diet was associated with lower odds of:
Autism diagnosis in MoBa (OR 0.78).
Social communication difficulties in MoBa and ALSPAC (OR 0.74).
No consistent association with restrictive/repetitive behaviors.
Sensitivity Analysis:
A plant-based diet was linked to fewer social communication difficulties.
A fish-based diet was associated with fewer restrictive behaviors.
Discussion and Conclusion
Key Insights:
A healthy prenatal diet may reduce the odds of autism diagnosis and social communication difficulties, especially in female offspring.
Limitations:
Inconsistent results for some autism traits.
Study relied on self-reported dietary information.
Conclusion: This study supports the idea that prenatal diet can influence autism-related outcomes, though more research is needed.
Supplemental Information
Data Sources: MoBa and ALSPAC provided a comprehensive data set for this study.
Ethical Considerations: Both studies were approved by respective ethics committees, and participants provided informed consent.

Food Safety for Vulnerable Populations
Overview
Food safety is crucial for everyone, but it's especially important for individuals with weakened immune systems. This guide helps older adults and those with cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, or autoimmune diseases avoid foodborne illnesses.
________________


The Immune System: Importance
* Function: The immune system defends against infections and foreign invaders. It comprises a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body.
* Decline with Age: Aging and certain diseases weaken the immune system. Medications for conditions like HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, and autoimmune diseases can also compromise immune function.
________________


Why Food Safety Matters
* Risk of Foodborne Illness: Contaminated food can harbor bacteria, viruses, or parasites that lead to food poisoning. In the U.S., 48 million people experience foodborne infections each year, with 128,000 hospitalized and 3,000 dying from these illnesses.
* Higher Vulnerability: Individuals with weakened immune systems face a greater risk of severe illness from foodborne pathogens, including prolonged sickness, hospitalization, or death.
Specific Risks
1. Older Adults (65+):
   * Higher hospitalization and mortality rates from foodborne illnesses due to aging organs and systems.
   * Slower digestion and reduced stomach acid increase the risk of bacterial growth.
   * Decline in immune function after age 50, with significant weakening by age 75.
2. People with Cancer:
   * Cancer therapies (radiation, chemotherapy) can weaken the immune system.
   * Cancer that spreads to the bone marrow further compromises immune response.
3. People with Diabetes:
   * Delayed immune response increases susceptibility to infections.
   * Potential damage to stomach acid production and digestive function allows harmful bacteria to thrive.
4. People with HIV/AIDS:
   * The virus severely damages the immune system, making individuals more vulnerable to infections, including foodborne illnesses.
5. Organ Transplant Recipients:
   * Immunosuppressants prevent organ rejection but also increase the risk of infections from foodborne pathogens.
6. People with Autoimmune Diseases:
   * Conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease involve immune system dysfunction.
   * Treatments often include immunosuppressants, making individuals more susceptible to infections.
________________


Key Recommendations
* Consult Healthcare Providers: Discuss specific foods and products to avoid based on individual health needs.
* Practice Safe Food Handling: Follow food safety guidelines to reduce the risk of contamination and infection.

* Consult Healthcare Providers: If facing nutrition-related problems, it's essential to discuss these with your healthcare provider.
________________


Understanding Food Safety
* Contamination Risks: Food and water can harbor germs that lead to foodborne illnesses.
* Definition: Food safety encompasses selecting, handling, preparing, and storing food to prevent contamination.
Food Safety Importance for People with HIV
* Increased Risk: Due to a compromised immune system, individuals with HIV are more susceptible to severe foodborne illnesses. Adhering to food safety guidelines is crucial for reducing this risk.
________________


Food Safety Guidelines for People with HIV
To prevent foodborne illnesses, individuals with HIV should:
Avoid:
* Raw or Undercooked Foods:
   * Raw eggs or products containing raw eggs (e.g., homemade cookie dough)
   * Raw or undercooked poultry, meat, and seafood
   * Unpasteurized milk, dairy products, and fruit juices
Follow the Four Basic Steps to Food Safety:
1. Clean: Wash hands, utensils, and surfaces frequently while preparing food.
2. Separate: Prevent cross-contamination by keeping raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables).
3. Cook: Use a food thermometer to ensure foods are cooked to safe temperatures.
4. Chill: Refrigerate or freeze perishable items within 2 hours of cooking or purchasing to prevent spoilage.

Artificial Sweeteners and Cancer
Overview
* What Are Artificial Sweeteners? Artificial sweeteners are chemically synthesized substances used as sugar substitutes in foods and beverages. They are significantly sweeter than table sugar, requiring much smaller amounts (200 to 20,000 times less) to achieve the same sweetness. Their caloric content is negligible, leading to their classification as nonnutritive.
* FDA Approval: The following six artificial sweeteners are approved by the FDA: saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), sucralose, neotame, and advantame. The FDA has reviewed safety studies for these sweeteners and found no evidence linking them to cancer in humans.
Animal Studies and Cancer Associations
* Initial Concerns: Early studies suggested a link between cyclamate and saccharin with bladder cancer in rats, leading to cyclamate's ban in the U.S. in 1969. Although more recent evaluations found no cancer link, it remains unapproved in the U.S.
* Saccharin: Initially listed as a potential human carcinogen, subsequent mechanistic studies indicated that the cancer-causing effects observed in rats do not apply to humans. It was removed from the carcinogen list in 2000.
* Aspartame: In 2023, the IARC classified aspartame as Group 2B, indicating it is possibly carcinogenic to humans based on limited evidence of liver cancer in humans and animal studies. However, JECFA concluded that aspartame does not exhibit adverse effects and maintains its safety assessment.
Epidemiological Studies
* Cancer Associations: Epidemiological studies have examined potential links between artificial sweeteners and various cancers. These studies have limitations and cannot firmly establish causation due to confounding factors.
General Findings
* Mixed Results: Research has produced inconsistent results regarding the association of artificially sweetened beverages with cancer risk. For example, some studies found links to kidney cancer, while others did not.
* NutriNet-Santé Study: This French cohort study found that high artificial sweetener intake was associated with a slight increase in cancer risk, particularly for obesity-related cancers.
* Lack of Evidence for Saccharin: No significant association between saccharin use and bladder cancer has emerged from human studies.
Aspartame Findings
* Conflicting Evidence: While some studies linked aspartame to liver cancer, others found no association, including large cohort studies like the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.
Other Sweeteners
* Sucralose: Studies consistently find no evidence linking sucralose to cancer risk.
* Acesulfame Potassium: The NutriNet-Santé Study suggested a slight increase in cancer risk, but further studies are needed for clarity.
* Neotame and Advantame: No research has reported on human cancer risks associated with these sweeteners.
Artificial Sweeteners and Obesity
* Weight Management: Many use artificial sweeteners to reduce calorie intake and combat obesity, a known cancer risk factor. However, evidence is mixed regarding their effectiveness.
* WHO Recommendation: In May 2023, the World Health Organization advised against using non-sugar sweeteners for weight management based on a systematic review of the evidence

Diabetes and Kidney Disease: What to Eat?
What to Know
About 1 in 3 American adults with diabetes also has chronic kidney disease (CKD). Navigating dietary needs can be challenging, but understanding both diabetes and CKD diets can help.
________________


Diabetes Diet
A healthy diabetes diet resembles a balanced diet for anyone. Focus on:
* Fruits and Vegetables: Plenty of colorful options.
* Healthy Fats: Sources like avocados and olive oil.
* Lean Proteins: Chicken, fish, and plant-based proteins.
* Limit: Salt, sugar, and refined carbohydrates (like cookies and sodas).
Your carbohydrate goal will vary based on factors like age and activity level. Adhering to your meal plan helps maintain blood sugar levels and protects kidney health.
________________


Kidney Diet
For CKD, certain foods need to be limited to safeguard kidney function. Your specific dietary needs depend on your CKD stage and whether you're on dialysis.
Foods to Limit:
* Sodium: Reducing sodium helps manage blood pressure and fluid retention. Focus on fresh, homemade meals and check labels for low sodium options (5% or less).
* Potassium: Too much can lead to heart issues. Foods high in potassium (like oranges and potatoes) may need to be restricted, while lower potassium options (like apples and carrots) can be included.
* Phosphorus: Excess phosphorus can weaken bones and harm blood vessels. Limit foods like meat, dairy, nuts, and dark sodas, as they are high in phosphorus.
* Protein: Balance is key. Too much protein can stress your kidneys, while too little isn’t healthy either. Work with a dietitian to find the right balance.
Avoid Herbal Supplements: Many can be harmful to kidneys. Consult your doctor before taking any supplements or vitamins.
________________


Recommended Foods
Here are some kidney-friendly and diabetes-friendly options:
* Fruits: Berries, grapes, cherries, apples, plums
* Vegetables: Cauliflower, onions, eggplant, turnips
* Proteins: Lean meats (poultry, fish), eggs, unsalted seafood
* Carbohydrates: White bread, bagels, sandwich buns, unsalted crackers, pasta
* Drinks: Water, clear diet sodas, unsweetened tea
For managing low blood sugar, consider switching from orange juice to apple or grape juice for a similar effect with less potassium.
________________


Late-Stage CKD
As CKD progresses, nutritional needs change, especially if you're on dialysis:
* Increased Protein Needs: Dialysis patients often require more protein due to the treatment's effects on the body.
* Fluid Restrictions: Monitor fluid intake to prevent buildup between treatments. Be alert for swelling in the legs, arms, or around the eyes.
* Blood Sugar Management: Blood sugar levels may fluctuate during dialysis. Regular monitoring by your doctor is essential.

Diabetes Basics
Key Points
* Chronic Condition: Diabetes is a long-lasting health condition that affects how your body converts food into energy.
* Types of Diabetes: The three main types are:
   * Type 1 Diabetes
   * Type 2 Diabetes
   * Gestational Diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy)
________________


Overview
When you eat, your body breaks down most foods into glucose, which then enters your bloodstream. This increase in blood sugar prompts your pancreas to release insulin, which allows the sugar to enter your cells for energy.
In diabetes, either your body doesn’t produce enough insulin or your cells don’t respond effectively to it. This results in elevated blood sugar levels, which can lead to serious health issues over time, including heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
While there is no cure for diabetes, effective management strategies include:
* Weight Loss: Achieving a healthy weight.
* Healthy Eating: Following a balanced diet.
* Physical Activity: Staying active.
* Medication: Taking prescribed medications as directed.
* Education and Support: Engaging in diabetes self-management education and support.
* Healthcare Appointments: Keeping regular medical check-ups.
________________


Types of Diabetes
Type 1 Diabetes
* Cause: An autoimmune reaction where the body mistakenly attacks insulin-producing cells.
* Insulin Dependence: Daily insulin administration is necessary for survival.
* Diagnosis: Commonly diagnosed in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. Symptoms can develop rapidly.
Learn More: [About Type 1 Diabetes]
Type 2 Diabetes
* Cause: The body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t produce enough.
* Onset: Develops over several years and is typically diagnosed in adults, though increasingly in younger populations.
* Symptoms: Often asymptomatic; regular blood sugar testing is essential for those at risk.
Learn More: [About Type 2 Diabetes]
Gestational Diabetes
* Description: Occurs in pregnant women who previously had no diabetes.
* Risks: Can lead to complications for both mother and baby, and increases the mother’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.
* Resolution: Usually resolves after childbirth, but associated risks can persist.
Learn More: [About Gestational Diabetes]
________________


Prevention
Prediabetes
* Prevalence: About 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. have prediabetes, yet more than 80% are unaware.
* Definition: Blood sugar levels are elevated but not high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes.
* Risks: Increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
Prevention Strategies:
* Lifestyle changes can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in those with prediabetes.

Understanding Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels.
Causes
Diabetes arises from issues with insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that controls blood sugar. The body may produce too little insulin, be resistant to insulin’s effects, or both. Here’s how the process typically works:
1. Digestion: When food is digested, glucose enters the bloodstream, providing fuel for the body.
2. Insulin Function: The pancreas releases insulin to move glucose from the bloodstream into cells (muscle, fat, etc.) for storage or energy use.
In individuals with diabetes, high blood sugar occurs because:
* The pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin.
* Cells do not respond effectively to insulin (insulin resistance).
* The liver may produce excess glucose.
Types of Diabetes
Type 1 Diabetes
* Prevalence: Accounts for 5% to 10% of diabetes cases in the U.S.
* Onset: Often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults.
* Insulin Dependency: The body produces little or no insulin due to immune system damage to insulin-producing cells. Daily insulin injections are necessary.
Type 2 Diabetes
* Prevalence: Makes up 90% to 95% of diabetes cases.
* Onset: Typically occurs in adults but is increasingly seen in younger populations due to rising obesity rates.
* Symptoms: May be asymptomatic; insulin resistance is common. Not all affected individuals are overweight.
Other Types
* LADA: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a slower-forming type 1.
* MODY: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young, a genetic form of diabetes.
* Gestational Diabetes: High blood sugar that develops during pregnancy in women without prior diabetes.
Family History: Having a parent or sibling with diabetes increases the likelihood of developing the disease.
Symptoms
High blood sugar can lead to several symptoms, including:
* Blurry vision
* Excessive thirst
* Fatigue
* Frequent urination
* Increased hunger
* Weight loss
Type 1 Symptoms: Develop quickly, often within weeks to months, leading to severe illness by diagnosis.
Type 2 Symptoms: Often develop slowly, with some individuals remaining asymptomatic.
Complications
If left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to serious complications, including:
* Eye Issues: Problems such as cataracts and diabetic retinopathy, potentially leading to blindness.
* Foot and Leg Problems: Sores and infections that may necessitate amputation.
* Nerve Damage: Causing pain, tingling, digestive issues, and erectile dysfunction.
* Kidney Damage: Potentially leading to kidney failure.
* Immune System Weakness: Resulting in more frequent infections.
* Cardiovascular Risks: Increased chance of heart attacks and strokes.
Diagnosis
Tests
* Urine Analysis: May indicate high urine sugar but is not definitive for diabetes.
* Blood Tests:
   * Fasting Blood Glucose: Diagnosed if levels are 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two tests.
   * Hemoglobin A1C Test: Normal (<5.7%), prediabetes (5.7%-6.4%), diabetes (≥6.5%).
   * Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: Diagnosis occurs if glucose levels reach 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher after two hours.
Screening Recommendations
* Overweight or Obese Adults: Starting at age 35, screening every 3 years.
* Overweight Women with Risk Factors: Screening before pregnancy.
* All Adults Age 35 or Older: Every 3 years, or earlier if risk factors exist (e.g., family history, high blood pressure).

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): What You Need to Know
Overview
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal (GI) condition, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and changes in bowel movements, including diarrhea, constipation, or a combination of both. It involves a complex interaction between the brain and the gut.
Nutritional Approaches
* Peppermint Oil: Some evidence suggests that peppermint oil may help alleviate IBS symptoms.
* Probiotics: Certain probiotics might improve symptoms, but current evidence is insufficient to confirm their effectiveness.
* Prebiotics: Research has not demonstrated clear benefits for IBS sufferers.
* Herbal Products: The evidence on other herbal remedies is limited, making it difficult to draw conclusions.
Psychological and Physical Approaches
* Gut-Directed Hypnotherapy: There is some evidence that this technique can alleviate IBS symptoms and enhance quality of life.
* Acupuncture: Research findings on the effectiveness of acupuncture for IBS are inconclusive.
* Meditation and Mindfulness: There is minimal research on the benefits of meditation, yoga, or relaxation techniques for IBS.
Safety of Complementary Health Approaches
* Probiotics and Peppermint Oil: Generally considered safe, but both can cause side effects. Comprehensive studies on the safety of probiotics are limited.
* Prebiotics: Typically safe but may cause side effects such as gassiness, bloating, abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea when taken in high doses (over 20 grams per day).
* Psychological and Physical Approaches: Generally have good safety records when used correctly, but individual health conditions (like pregnancy) may affect safety.
Complementary Health Approaches
Complementary health approaches encompass a variety of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that originate outside mainstream medicine. These approaches can be classified into different categories:
1. Nutritional: Includes special diets, dietary supplements, herbs, probiotics, and microbial-based therapies.
2. Psychological: Involves practices like meditation, hypnosis, music therapies, and relaxation techniques.
3. Physical: Encompasses treatments like acupuncture, massage, and spinal manipulation.
4. Combination Approaches: Integrate multiple therapies, such as yoga (psychological and physical) or mindful eating (psychological and nutritional).

Probiotics: Usefulness and Safety
What Are Probiotics?
Probiotics are live microorganisms that may provide health benefits when consumed or applied. Commonly found in yogurt, fermented foods, dietary supplements, and beauty products, they can enhance gut health. However, severe infections have been reported in premature infants given probiotics, prompting warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
While many view bacteria as harmful, many microorganisms are beneficial. Some help digest food, destroy disease-causing cells, or produce vitamins. Probiotics often consist of organisms similar to those naturally present in our bodies.
Types of Probiotic Bacteria
Probiotics mainly include bacteria from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium groups. Yeasts like Saccharomyces boulardii are also used. Different strains may have different effects; thus, not all probiotics function the same way.
Prebiotics vs. Probiotics
Prebiotics are nondigestible components that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms. They are not the same as probiotics.
What Are Synbiotics?
Synbiotics are products that combine both probiotics and prebiotics for synergistic effects.
Popularity of Probiotics
According to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, about 4 million U.S. adults (1.6%) reported using probiotics or prebiotics in the past 30 days. Probiotic usage among adults quadrupled from 2007 to 2012. In that same survey, around 300,000 children aged 4 to 17 (0.5%) had also used probiotics or prebiotics recently.
How Might Probiotics Work?
Probiotics can:
* Help maintain or restore a healthy microbiome.
* Produce beneficial substances.
* Influence immune responses.
Regulation of Probiotics in the U.S.
Probiotics can be regulated as dietary supplements, food ingredients, or drugs based on their intended use. Many are sold as dietary supplements, which don’t require FDA approval before marketing. Claims about structure or function are allowed without FDA approval, but health claims require it. Probiotics marketed as drugs must undergo rigorous clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
The Microbiome
The microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies. Research, including the Human Microbiome Project, has explored how these microorganisms affect health. Agencies like the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) fund studies on how dietary interactions with the microbiome may lead to health benefits.
Scientific Evidence on Probiotics
While research has investigated various health conditions associated with probiotics, definitive conclusions on effectiveness and safety remain elusive. Promising areas of research include:
* Prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, including that caused by Clostridium difficile.
* Prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in premature infants.
* Treatment of infant colic and periodontal disease.
* Induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

Probiotics: Usefulness and Safety
Overview of Probiotics
Probiotics are live microorganisms that may offer health benefits when consumed or applied to the body. Commonly found in yogurt, fermented foods, dietary supplements, and beauty products, they play a significant role in promoting gut health. However, there have been reports of severe infections in premature infants given probiotics, prompting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue warnings about their use.
Understanding Microorganisms
While many associate bacteria with illness, many microorganisms are beneficial. They assist in digesting food, eliminating disease-causing cells, and producing essential vitamins. Probiotics typically consist of organisms similar to those naturally found in our bodies.
Types of Probiotic Bacteria
The most common probiotic bacteria belong to two main groups: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Yeasts like Saccharomyces boulardii can also serve as probiotics. Each strain may have different effects, meaning that one type of Lactobacillus may not produce the same benefits as another.
Distinguishing Prebiotics from Probiotics
It’s important to note that prebiotics and probiotics are not the same. Prebiotics are nondigestible food components that selectively promote the growth or activity of beneficial microorganisms.
What Are Synbiotics?
Synbiotics are products that combine probiotics and prebiotics, offering potential synergistic benefits.
Popularity and Usage of Probiotics
According to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), approximately 4 million U.S. adults (1.6%) reported using probiotics or prebiotics in the past 30 days. This figure reflects a significant increase, with probiotic usage among adults quadrupling from 2007 to 2012. The survey also indicated that around 300,000 children aged 4 to 17 (0.5%) had used these products recently.
Mechanisms of Action
Probiotics may:
* Help maintain or restore a healthy microbiome.
* Produce beneficial substances.
* Influence the body’s immune response.
Regulation in the United States
In the U.S., the regulation of probiotics is complex. Depending on their intended use, probiotics can be classified as dietary supplements, food ingredients, or drugs. Many are marketed as dietary supplements, which do not require prior FDA approval. While they can make structure/function claims, health claims need FDA approval. Probiotics marketed as drugs must undergo stringent clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Understanding the Microbiome
The microbiome consists of the diverse community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies. Research, including the Human Microbiome Project, has focused on how these microorganisms impact health. Organizations like the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) support studies exploring the interactions between diet and the microbiome, aiming to identify beneficial health effects.
Scientific Evidence and Effectiveness
Extensive research has been conducted on probiotics, yet many questions about their effectiveness and safety for various health conditions remain unanswered. Promising areas of study include:
* Prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, including that caused by Clostridium difficile.
* Prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in premature infants.
* Treatment of infant colic and periodontal disease.
* Induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
Despite the promise shown in these areas, researchers continue to investigate which specific probiotics are effective, optimal dosages, and which individuals may benefit the most.
For a deeper understanding of specific health conditions related to probiotics, ongoing research is essential.

Food Allergy Overview
Definition
A food allergy occurs when the body’s immune system abnormally reacts to normally harmless substances, such as proteins found in milk or eggs. This condition is a significant public health issue affecting both children and adults. Globally, up to 250 million people may have food allergies, with most affected by one to three foods. Though over 170 foods have been identified as allergy triggers, eight major allergen groups account for 90% of food allergies. Symptoms can affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and respiratory tract.
Food Allergy vs. Food Intolerance
* Food Allergy: Involves an immune system reaction to specific proteins in foods.
* Food Intolerance: Does not involve the immune system but can cause similar symptoms.
Common Food Allergens
* Egg
* Milk
* Peanut
* Tree Nut
* Wheat
* Sesame
* Soy
* Fruits and Vegetables
* Seafood and Shellfish
Click on each allergen to learn about:
* Specific allergy information

Tree Nut Allergy Diet
General Guidelines for Tree Nut Allergy
To maintain an allergy-free diet, it is essential to avoid all foods or products that contain tree nuts. Tree nut allergies can cause serious reactions, so reading food labels is critical.
In the U.S., all packaged food must clearly state if it contains tree nuts, including the specific type of nut, as mandated by the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA).
Important Distinctions
* Peanuts vs. Tree Nuts: Peanuts are distinct from tree nuts. Some individuals with tree nut allergies may also react to peanuts, while others may not. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized guidance.
Nuts to Avoid
Stay away from the following tree nuts:
* Almonds
* Beechnuts
* Brazil nuts
* Butternuts
* Cashews
* Chestnuts
* Coconut (consult your provider)
* Filberts (hazelnuts)
* Ginkgo nuts
* Hickory nuts
* Lychee nuts
* Macadamia nuts
* Pecans
* Pine nuts (pignolia)
* Pistachios
* Walnuts
Foods to Avoid
These foods often contain tree nuts:
* Caponata (may contain pine nuts)
* Gianduja (chocolate mixed with nuts)
* Marzipan or almond paste
* Natural nut extracts
* Nougat
* Artificial nuts (reflavored peanuts)
* Nut butters (e.g., cashew or almond butter)
* Chocolate hazelnut spread
* Nut oils and pastes
* Pesto (may contain pine nuts, walnuts, or cashews)
* Praline
Additional Considerations
* Artificial Nuts: These are peanuts that have been deflavored and then reflavored with a nut taste.
* Coconut: Although classified as a tree nut by the FDA, it is actually a fruit. Many people with tree nut allergies can eat coconut; consult your provider.
* Shea Nuts: Also classified as nuts by the FDA, shea nut allergies are rare. Check with your provider about using shea products.
* Natural Extracts: Avoid foods with natural extracts, such as pure almond extract and natural wintergreen extract.
Cross-Contamination Risks
* Ethnic foods, baked goods, and candies may be cross-contaminated with tree nuts.
* Tree nuts are often found in sauces, cereals, crackers, and ice creams.
* Foods without tree nuts can be contaminated during manufacturing. The law does not require companies to include advisory statements like "made in a facility with tree nuts."
Products Not Covered by FALCPA
The following items may not have FALCPA labeling:
* Foods not regulated by the FDA
* Makeup and personal care products
* Prescription and over-the-counter medicines and supplements
* Toys, crafts, and pet foods
Emergency Preparedness

Eating, Diet, & Nutrition for Lactose Intolerance
Managing Lactose Intolerance
Dietary Changes
If you have lactose intolerance, consult with your doctor or a dietitian to create a dietary plan that minimizes symptoms while ensuring you receive adequate nutrition. This is especially important for children with lactose intolerance.
Understanding Lactose
You may not need to eliminate lactose completely. Most individuals can tolerate some lactose without experiencing symptoms. Research indicates that many can consume about 12 grams of lactose (approximately 1 cup of milk) with minimal issues.
Tips for Tolerance
You might be able to tolerate milk and milk products better if you:
* Consume small amounts at a time and have them with meals.
* Introduce dairy gradually to see how your body reacts.
* Opt for yogurt and hard cheeses (e.g., cheddar or Swiss), which generally have lower lactose levels.
* Use lactase supplements to aid in lactose digestion.
Lactose-Free Options
Lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk products can help you manage your lactose intake while still providing the nutritional benefits of dairy. These alternatives are widely available and nutritious.
Ensuring Calcium and Vitamin D Intake
Getting enough calcium and vitamin D is crucial for those with lactose intolerance. While milk and dairy are common sources, there are plenty of lactose-free options, including:
* Fish with soft bones (e.g., canned salmon, sardines)
* Leafy greens (e.g., broccoli)
* Oranges
* Nuts (e.g., almonds, Brazil nuts)
* Dried beans
* Calcium-fortified products (e.g., certain cereals, fruit juices, soy milk)
Vitamin D Sources
Vitamin D aids in calcium absorption. Ensure your diet includes:
* Eggs
* Certain fish (e.g., salmon)
* Foods with added vitamin D (e.g., fortified cereals and orange juice)
If you can tolerate small amounts of dairy, opt for those fortified with vitamin D. Sunlight exposure also helps your body produce vitamin D.
Nutrient Sufficiency
Discuss with your doctor or dietitian to ensure you’re meeting your nutritional needs. Consult your healthcare provider before using dietary supplements or alternative therapies, and talk about safe sun exposure practices.

Role of the gut microbiome in chronic diseases: a narrative review
Gut Microbiome and Autoimmune Diseases (AIDs)
The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) is influenced by genetic predispositions and environmental factors, notably gut microbiota disturbances. Emerging evidence suggests that dysbiosis (imbalanced gut microbiota) plays a key role in the immunopathogenesis of various autoimmune conditions.
________________


Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disease primarily affecting joints. Environmental factors like diet, smoking, and infections contribute to gut/oral dysbiosis and RA onset.
* Microbiome Alterations: RA patients show reduced gut microbial diversity, with increased abundance of Prevotella species (notably Prevotella copri) and Collinsella, and decreased levels of Faecalibacterium.
* Key Findings:
   * Germ-free mice: Protected from experimental arthritis, suggesting a microbiome connection.
   * Collinsella: Increases gut permeability and IL-17A expression, a cytokine involved in RA inflammation.
   * SCFAs (Short-Chain Fatty Acids): SCFAs, such as butyrate, suppress inflammation in RA. Mice deficient in SCFA receptors had exacerbated RA inflammation.
   * Zonulin: Increased gut permeability is linked to RA. Therapies targeting gut permeability (e.g., butyrate supplementation) may help delay RA onset and severity.
________________


Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)
Alterations in gut microbiota, including reduced bacterial diversity, precede metabolic symptoms of T1D.
* Microbiome Alterations: Increased Bacteroides and decreased SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) have been observed in T1D patients.
* Gut Permeability: Increased gut permeability and dysbiosis precede T1D development, with gut permeability modulation potentially influencing disease incidence.
* SCFAs and T1D:
   * Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice: High SCFA diets (acetate and butyrate) protected against T1D through immune-modulating effects.
   * SCFAs play a role in reducing gut inflammation and improving immune function, potentially delaying or preventing T1D.
________________


Atopic Eczema
Atopic eczema is a chronic skin condition with immune dysregulation, gut microbiota imbalance, and skin barrier dysfunction.
* Microbiome Alterations: Increased Clostridia, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus and decreased Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides have been linked to eczema. SCFA producers, like Coprococcus eutactus, are lower in patients with severe eczema.
* SCFAs: Reduced levels of butyrate and propionate are associated with severe eczema, likely due to a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria (F. prausnitzii).
* Microbial Function: Dysbiosis affects the immune system and gut-barrier integrity, potentially driving eczema progression.
________________


Atopic Asthma
The rapid rise in asthma prevalence, especially in industrialized nations, is linked to altered gut microbiota in early life.
* Microbiome Alterations: Proteobacteria (e.g., Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria) dominate in asthma patients. Dysbiosis early in life, influenced by factors like antibiotic use and cesarean birth, has been linked to asthma.
* SCFAs and Asthma: SCFAs have protective effects against asthma by reducing airway inflammation and immune cell activity. High levels of butyrate and propionate in infants reduce asthma risk.
* Histamine-Producing Bacteria: Increased histamine-secreting bacteria in asthma patients correlate with disease severity, suggesting microbiota’s role in modulating immune responses in asthma.
________________


Gut Inflammation and Bowel Disorders
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
IBS involves abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, with gut microbial dysbiosis contributing to low-grade inflammation.
* Microbiome Alterations: Increased Firmicutes (e.g., Ruminococcus, Clostridium) and reduced Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium have been observed in IBS patients.
* SCFAs and IBS: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii plays a key role in maintaining gut health, and its reduction is associated with worsened IBS symptoms. SCFAs, particularly butyrate, improve gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation.
* Dietary Management: A low-FODMAP diet has shown efficacy in reducing IBS symptoms by modulating gut microbiota composition, though not all patients respond equally.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
IBD encompasses Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), both characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation.
* Microbiome Alterations: Decreased microbial diversity, specifically lower levels of butyrate-producing Firmicutes (e.g., Faecalibacterium and Roseburia) and increased Proteobacteria, are common in IBD patients.
* SCFAs and IBD: Butyrate supports colon health by enhancing epithelial barrier integrity and reducing inflammation. Therapies aiming to restore butyrate levels, such as probiotics, may help in managing IBD.
Gut Microbiome and Cardiometabolic Diseases
1. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
* Gut Microbiota and CVD: Changes in gut microbiota composition and function are linked to CVD development. Mechanistic studies in rats have shown associations with myocardial infarction severity.
* Hypertension:
   * Human Studies:
      * In the TwinsUK cohort, self-reported hypertension showed no relation to 68 microbiota markers.
      * The CARDIA study observed that increased gut microbiome diversity was modestly associated with reduced systolic blood pressure.
      * The FINRISK study found weak overall associations between gut microbiota composition and blood pressure but noted changes in microbiota genera related to hypertension.
      * Specifically, Lactobacillus paracasei was linked to lower mean arterial pressure and reduced dietary sodium intake.
* Diet and Gut Microbiota:
   * Western Diet: High in choline and carnitine, can increase cardiovascular risk through trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) production.
   * Mediterranean Diet: Associated with reduced blood pressure and body-mass index, particularly when combined with fasting.
* Probiotics:
   * Rodent Studies: Probiotics like Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus improved heart function after myocardial infarction.
   * Meta-Analysis: Probiotic use resulted in significant blood pressure reduction.
   * Atherosclerosis: A. muciniphila supplementation protected against atherosclerosis in a Western diet model.
2. Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)
* Gut Microbiota in T2DM: Patients with T2DM often have altered gut microbiota. Key findings include:
   * Negative Associations: Genera such as Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia.
   * Positive Associations: Genera like Ruminococcus and Fusobacterium.
* Microbial Metabolites:
   * Butyrate: Linked to insulin sensitivity. SCFAs like butyrate trigger GLP-1 secretion, impacting insulin release and appetite.
   * Microbiome-Metabolite Score: Strongly associated with T2DM prevalence and incidence, suggesting these metabolites as key links between microbiome composition and health.
3. Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
* Gut-Liver Axis: Dysbiosis can increase intestinal permeability, leading to endotoxemia and liver damage.
* Microbiota Changes:
   * Alterations: Decreased alpha and beta diversity, increased Proteobacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae, and reduced butyrate producers.
   * Advanced NAFLD/NASH: Decreased levels of F. prausnitzii and variable SCFA levels (e.g., acetate higher in advanced stages).
* Mechanisms: Microbial species can metabolize bile acids or produce toxins that affect liver health. SCFAs have dual roles, potentially promoting or preventing NAFLD depending on their signaling pathways.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
* Gut-Kidney Axis: Gut dysbiosis in CKD involves reduced microbial diversity and increased levels of harmful bacteria.
* Microbiota Changes:
   * Decreased: Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillaceae, Akkermansia, and Prevotellaceae.
   * Increased: Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococci, and Clostridium perfringes.
* SCFAs: Decreased in CKD, which contributes to disease progression. Increased proteolytic bacteria lead to harmful uremic toxins.
* Therapeutic Interventions:
   * Prebiotics, Probiotics, and Synbiotics: Shown to potentially improve gut microbiota, reduce inflammation, and modulate uremic toxins in CKD patients.
Effects of a Healthy Diet Mediated by the Gut Microbiome
1. Diet and Gut Microbiome Interaction
* Dietary Interventions: Clinical studies have shown that dietary changes can impact gut microbiota. For example:
   * Fiber-Rich Diets: Improve glucose control and metabolic profiles in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients and reduce coronary heart disease risk.
   * Individual Variation: Postprandial glycemic responses vary among individuals eating the same meals. Considering gut microbiota composition can help design personalized diets for better glucose control.
2. Microbiome Structure and Cardiometabolic Markers
* Study Findings:
   * Microbial Diversity: Correlated with fasting and postprandial biomarkers. Notably, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) was positively linked with microbial species richness.
   * Predictive Value: Gut microbiome composition was a better predictor of postprandial triglycerides and insulin levels than glucose.
   * Diet Influence: Healthy plant-based diets shape gut microbiome composition. Approximately 10% of microbiome composition variance was explained by eating patterns.
3. Diet-Specific Microbial Changes
* Bacterial Taxa:
   * Healthy vs. Unhealthy Diets: Bacterial species were grouped by their association with plant-based (DietPositive) or animal-based (DietNegative) foods.
   * Mediterranean Diet: A 12-month study found significant changes in gut microbiota.
      * DietPositive Bacteria: Associated with lower inflammation markers and better health indicators.
      * DietNegative Bacteria: Linked to higher inflammation and frailty.
   * Overlap with Other Studies: Findings were consistent with studies on omega-3 fatty acids and soluble fiber (inulin) supplementation.
4. Effect of Dietary Fat and Carbohydrates
* Type of Dietary Fat:
   * Saturated Fat: Increased Proteobacteria abundance.
   * Unsaturated Fat: Increased butyrate-producing bacteria.
* Carbohydrate Sources:
   * Resistant Starch Types: Different forms of resistant starch (maize, potato, tapioca) impacted gut microbiome composition and SCFA production in specific ways.
      * Maize Starch: Increased butyrate producers.
      * Tapioca Starch: Shifted propionate proportions, increasing succinate-producing bacteria.
   * Dose Dependency: The effects were dose-dependent, plateauing at 35 g/day.
5. Conclusions and Implications
* Dietary Impact: Specific dietary interventions can target and modulate gut microbiome composition, influencing metabolic health and disease outcomes.
* Personalized Diets: Understanding individual responses to diet and gut microbiome interactions can lead to more effective, personalized dietary recommendations.
