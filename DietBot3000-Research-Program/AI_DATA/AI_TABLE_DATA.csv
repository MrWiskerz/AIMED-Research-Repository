"Composition of Fruits and Vegetables: Water, Minerals, Carbohydrates, and Other Nutrients",,,,,,,,,,
Component,Details,Examples/Percentages,,,,,,,,
Water (2.2.1),"Present in vegetal cells in bound, colloidal bound, and constitution forms. Vital for physiological processes and impacts storage and tissue reserves.",Vegetables: 90-96% water; Fruits: 80-90% water,,,,,,,,
Mineral Substances (2.2.2),"Present as salts or complex organic combinations (e.g., chlorophyll). Rich in vegetables, essential for diet (e.g., potassium, calcium, phosphorus). Contribute to body's acid-basic balance.","Vegetables: 0.60-1.80% minerals. Rich sources: spinach, carrots, cabbage. Mineral-rich fruits: strawberries, cherries, peaches. Calcium-rich vegetables: beans, cabbage. Ca/P ratio: 0.7 (adults), 1.0 (children)",,,,,,,,
Carbohydrates (2.2.3),"Main component of fruits and vegetables, over 90% of dry matter. Provide energy and structural support (e.g., cellulose, starch). Play a role in energy storage, flavor, preservation, and biological functions.","Adults should consume about 500g carbohydrates per day. Includes sugars (glucose, sucrose, etc.) and polysaccharides (cellulose, pectins).",,,,,,,,
Fats (2.2.4),"Low in fruits and vegetables, but significant in seeds and nuts.","Less than 0.5% in most fruits/vegetables. Nuts: up to 55% fat (apricot kernels 40%, grape seeds 16%)",,,,,,,,
Organic Acids (2.2.5),"Contribute tartness, preserve food by lowering pH, and influence color. Found in citrus (citric acid), apples (malic acid), grapes (tartaric acid). Fermentation yields lactic and acetic acid, which preserves foods like sauerkraut and vinegar.","pH ≤ 4.6 prevents growth of harmful bacteria. Citric acid: oranges/lemons, Malic acid: apples, Tartaric acid: grapes",,,,,,,,
Nitrogen-containing Substances (2.2.6),"Found as proteins, amino acids, nitrates, etc. Vegetal proteins are less complete than animal proteins.","Vegetables: 1.0-5.5% nitrogen substances, fruits: less than 1%.",,,,,,,,
Vitamins (2.2.7),"Vital for body processes, divided into fat-soluble (A, D, E, K) and water-soluble (C, B complex). Essential for metabolism and health. Vitamin A found as beta-carotene in plants; Vitamin C needed for collagen production.","Vitamin A (precursor beta-carotene): carrots, spinach. Vitamin C: citrus fruits, tomatoes, cabbage.",,,,,,,,
Enzymes (2.2.8),"Biological catalysts for reactions, affecting ripening, texture, flavor, and spoilage. Heat and pH affect enzyme activity.","Enzymes like pectin methyl esterase are key in processing (e.g., tomato paste).",,,,,,,,
Turgidity and Texture (2.2.9),"Turgidity depends on osmotic pressure and water content, impacting texture (crispness, wilting). Structural components like cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectic substances affect firmness and texture, especially in processed foods.",Softening in cooked vegetables is due to pectin hydrolysis. Calcium salts help firm processed fruits/vegetables.,,,,,,,,
Sources of Color (2.2.10),"Colors due to chlorophylls, carotenoids, flavonoids, and tannins. Processing and pH affect pigment stability. Carotenoids provide yellow/orange; anthocyanins contribute red/purple/blue.","Chlorophylls: green (spinach). Carotenoids: yellow/orange (carrots, tomatoes). Anthocyanins: red/purple (berries, grapes).",,,,,,,,
