The Mayo Clinic Diet consists of two main phases:
1. Lose It! Phase: This initial two-week phase aims to kickstart weight loss, with participants potentially losing 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kilograms) safely. During this period, individuals focus on integrating five healthy habits while eliminating five unhealthy ones, along with adopting an additional five bonus habits. This phase serves to provide quick results, boosting motivation while instilling important lifestyle practices.
2. Live It! Phase: This lifelong approach focuses on long-term health and continued weight management. Participants delve deeper into making informed food choices, understanding portion sizes, and planning meals effectively. With consistent efforts, individuals can expect to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) weekly until they reach their target weight, promoting sustainable maintenance of that weight.
To support participants in their journey, the Mayo Clinic Diet offers various electronic tools, including food and exercise journals and weight trackers, to help individuals stay on track.
Emphasis on Healthy Eating
The Mayo Clinic Diet simplifies healthy eating by teaching participants how to estimate portion sizes and plan balanced meals. Rather than requiring precise calorie counting, the focus is on enjoying nutritious foods that promote satiety and support weight loss.
At the foundation of the program is the Mayo Clinic Healthy Weight Pyramid, which emphasizes filling, low-calorie foods. This pyramid encourages participants to prioritize fruits and vegetables, which have numerous health benefits, while suggesting a reduced intake from the upper tiers, which consist of less healthful choices.
Increasing Physical Activity
The Mayo Clinic Diet also emphasizes the importance of physical activity. The program encourages a minimum of 30 minutes of daily exercise, with additional activity recommended for enhanced health benefits and weight loss. A structured exercise plan includes simple walking routines and resistance exercises designed to promote fat loss and improve mental health. Furthermore, the program advocates for increased movement throughout the day, such as opting for stairs over elevators.
For individuals who may have been sedentary or have health concerns, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before commencing a new exercise regimen. Most can begin with short activity sessions, gradually increasing their duration.
Sample Daily Menu
The Mayo Clinic Diet offers various meal plans catering to different dietary preferences, ensuring that participants can find a plan that suits their needs. Here’s a glimpse of a typical daily menu for a 1,200-calorie Mediterranean eating plan:
* Breakfast: Overnight oats topped with fresh berries and slices of pear.
* Lunch: A hearty Tuscan white bean soup, garnished with a drizzle of pesto.
* Dinner: A delicious sheet-pan roast chicken accompanied by broccolini, onions, and tomatoes.
* Snack: A refreshing combination of sliced bell peppers and a banana.
Desserts are permissible but limited to 75 calories daily. To manage this allowance effectively, participants are encouraged to think of their sweet calorie quota across the week, allowing flexibility in their choices.
Expected Results
The Mayo Clinic Diet is designed to facilitate weight loss of 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kilograms) during the initial two-week phase. Participants will transition into the Live It! phase, where they can continue to lose weight steadily at a rate of 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week until reaching their desired weight. By adhering to the sustainable habits developed throughout the program, individuals can maintain their goal weight for life.
While numerous diets can yield short-term weight loss, the Mayo Clinic Diet is distinctive in its focus on helping individuals sustain their weight loss by making informed food choices, managing setbacks, and implementing lasting lifestyle changes.
Moreover, adhering to a nutritious diet—like the Mayo Clinic Diet—can significantly lower the risk of weight-related health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea. For individuals already grappling with these issues, weight loss can lead to marked improvements in their health status, regardless of the specific diet followed.
The diet advocates for an array of healthful foods, including ample servings of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, beans, fish, and healthy fats, further mitigating the risk of developing various health conditions.
Safety and Considerations
The Mayo Clinic Diet is generally regarded as safe for most adults, encouraging the consumption of unlimited vegetables and fruits. While these foods are rich in essential nutrients and fiber, individuals unaccustomed to high-fiber diets may initially experience temporary digestive changes, such as gas, as their bodies adjust.
Furthermore, the natural sugars found in fruits can influence carbohydrate intake—especially when consumed in large quantities—which may cause a transient rise in blood sugar levels or specific blood fats. However, this effect is typically mitigated through weight loss.
Individuals with diabetes or other health concerns are encouraged to work closely with their healthcare providers to tailor the Mayo Clinic Diet to their specific needs. For example, those with diabetes may benefit from consuming more vegetables than fruits, favoring vegetable snacks over fruit-only options.

Introduction
Recent decades have seen a rise in portion sizes alongside increasing obesity rates. Research indicates that larger food and beverage portions lead to significant increases in energy intake, suggesting that portion availability can disrupt energy balance regulation. In 2010, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee affirmed a strong correlation between portion size and body weight, emphasizing the need for portion control to manage energy intake.
This review aims to expand on existing literature linking portion size with energy intake and body weight, while also discussing strategies for moderating the impact of large portions, especially for energy-dense foods. Additionally, it will explore how portion control can be used to enhance the intake of nutrient-dense foods and the various strategies applied in weight management.
Studies Linking Portion Size and Intake
Early Studies
The connection between portion size and food intake was first highlighted in a 1957 study by Siegel, who observed a "completion compulsion," leading individuals to consume entire servings. Despite initial attempts to establish this link, many studies yielded inconclusive results until more recent investigations began to demonstrate a clearer relationship.
Amorphous Foods
Studies conducted at the author's lab investigated the impact of portion sizes on energy intake, starting with macaroni and cheese. Results indicated that larger portions led to a 30% increase in intake without participants noticing significant differences in portion sizes.
Unit Foods and Packages
Subsequent studies demonstrated that even foods with defined shapes, like sandwiches, showed a clear effect of portion size on intake. Additionally, variations in package sizes of snacks influenced consumption, with larger packages leading to increased energy intake without compensatory adjustments at later meals.
Beverages
Research also examined the effects of beverage portion sizes on overall energy intake. Larger portions of caloric beverages significantly increased total energy intake during meals, although efforts to reduce consumption through labeling have shown limited effectiveness.
Restaurant Portions
Research on portion sizes in restaurants reveals that consumers often remain unaware of the portions they are served, particularly in distracting environments.
1. Pasta Dish Study:
   * A controlled restaurant study found that customers served 50% more pasta consumed 43% more without recognizing the portion difference, highlighting a critical issue in restaurant dining where oversized portions can contribute to excess calorie consumption.
2. Consumer Awareness: Surveys indicate a significant percentage of diners are unaware of their portion needs and would prefer smaller servings, suggesting a gap in consumer education about appropriate portion sizes.
3. Chef Insights: Chefs reported that presentation and cost often dictate portion sizes more than nutritional considerations, revealing the influence of culinary norms on consumer behavior and potential solutions.
Persistent Effects of Portion Size
The effects of portion size extend beyond single meals. Research indicates that sustained exposure to larger portions leads to increased energy intake over time.
1. Longitudinal Studies:
   * Studies demonstrate that increasing portion sizes over consecutive days leads to significant cumulative increases in energy intake, with participants failing to compensate for higher intakes in subsequent meals.
2. Box Lunch Experiment: Employees provided with larger portions over a month showed a significant increase in daily caloric intake without compensatory reductions, suggesting that the habitual exposure to large portions contributes to long-term energy imbalance.
Leveraging Portion Size for Nutritional Benefits
Recognizing the impact of portion sizes can also be harnessed to promote the consumption of nutrient-dense foods.
1. Vegetable Intake Studies:
   * Increasing vegetable portions can enhance overall intake and reduce caloric consumption. For instance, substituting vegetables for higher-calorie foods has been shown to improve dietary quality without increasing caloric intake.
2. Dietary Guidelines: Emphasizing the importance of increasing vegetable and fruit portions aligns with strategies to improve overall diet quality while managing caloric intake.
Recommendations and Strategic Approaches
The emphasis on portion control must consider the energy density of foods.
1. Substituting Low-Energy-Dense Foods: Encouraging consumers to fill their diets with lower-energy-dense foods can facilitate greater satiety without excessive caloric intake.
2. Energy Density Impact: Studies demonstrate that reducing energy density while maintaining food weight can lead to significant reductions in caloric intake, promoting healthier eating habits.
3. Effective Messaging: Rather than simply advising consumers to "eat less," a more effective strategy would focus on promoting higher consumption of low-energy-dense foods while regulating portions of high-energy-dense items.
Portion Size and Weight Management
Despite extensive research demonstrating the impact of portion size on energy intake, the connection between portion size and body weight remains less clearly defined.
1. Experimental vs. Population Data: Studies indicate that overweight individuals may consume larger portions of high-energy-dense foods, yet the associations are not consistently robust across studies.
2. Need for Further Research: There is a clear need for more comprehensive studies to elucidate the relationship between portion size, energy density, and body weight regulation.
3. Professional Guidelines: Organizations emphasize the importance of portion control in weight management while acknowledging gaps in current research, advocating for continued exploration of effective portion control strategies.
Summary of Key Findings on Portion Size and Weight Management
The increasing prevalence of obesity has intensified scrutiny on portion sizes, with evidence linking larger portions to increased energy intake. Initial studies yielded mixed results until recent research established a clearer connection. Notably, the consumption of amorphous foods and unit foods demonstrated that larger portions directly correlate with greater caloric intake, irrespective of participants' awareness.
Portion-Control Tools
Educational tools aimed at helping individuals recognize appropriate portion sizes are vital in combating "portion distortion." Dietary counseling often incorporates measuring tools (e.g., scales and cups) to enhance estimation accuracy, although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing their efficacy are limited. Two RCTs highlighted the effectiveness of specially designed portion-control plates, with participants experiencing notable weight loss compared to those receiving standard care.
Portion-Controlled Foods and Beverages
Strategies to structure food environments can mitigate overconsumption of energy-dense foods. The use of pre-portioned foods (PPFs), including entrées and snacks, shows promise in reducing caloric intake. Systematic evaluations indicate that liquid meal replacements can effectively support weight loss, with substantial evidence supporting their role in structured diet programs. However, further research is necessary to clarify optimal consumption practices and the long-term appeal of these interventions.
Pre-Portioned Foods (PPFs)
Solid PPFs, such as conventional foods packaged in single-serving sizes, may provide a more appealing option than liquid meal replacements. Studies indicate that solid PPFs enhance satiety and can lead to significant weight loss. Research highlights that providing PPFs as part of structured weight-loss programs improves compliance and fosters greater weight loss over time.
Recommendations for Effective Use of Portion-Control Strategies
* Incorporation of Technology: Electronic tools offering immediate feedback on portion sizes could enhance understanding and adherence to appropriate portions.
* Variety and Sustainability: The diverse array of PPFs may facilitate sustained use, as evidenced by studies indicating their effectiveness in long-term weight management.
* Customization: Tailoring portion-control strategies to individual needs is crucial for fostering lasting behavioral changes.
Conclusions and Future Directions
While evidence supports the role of portion sizes in regulating energy intake and facilitating weight loss, further studies are needed to establish the long-term effects of portion-control tools on dietary understanding and sustainable weight management. Exploration of optimal portion sizes and their role in consumer behavior remains essential for effective obesity prevention strategies.

Beyond the ‘Eat Less’ Message
While portion control is crucial for weight management, simply advising people to "eat less" is not the most effective strategy. Instead, promoting the consumption of low-energy-dense foods alongside managing portions of high-energy-dense foods can facilitate effective weight control. Studies show that reducing dietary energy density allows individuals to eat satisfying amounts while controlling their weight.
1. RCT Evidence: In trials, participants incorporating low-energy-dense foods, such as soups, experienced greater weight loss compared to those consuming high-energy-dense snacks. Over 12 months, those counseled to consume more fruits and vegetables had a 23% greater weight loss compared to those focused solely on portion control.
2. Food Volume and Satisfaction: Lowering energy density allowed participants to consume more food by weight, leading to reduced hunger and increased satisfaction with their diets.
3. Dietary Recommendations: Evidence supports advising individuals to focus on limiting high-energy-dense foods while encouraging the intake of low-energy-dense foods.
Conclusions
In a landscape dominated by large portions of energy-dense foods, effective strategies must be developed to help individuals align their intake with energy needs. Tools for teaching portion recognition exist, but their long-term efficacy is uncertain. Pre-portioned foods (PPFs) show promise in aiding weight loss when used in place of self-selected diets, although further research is needed to establish their long-term benefits. Importantly, understanding energy density will empower individuals to make healthier food choices, enabling satisfying consumption while managing body weight.

Meal Planning as a Tool for Improved Diet Quality
Background
In recent years, eating habits in industrialized countries have significantly transformed. Factors such as time scarcity and changes in food sources—specifically the decline in home-prepared meals—have negatively impacted dietary quality. Previous studies have linked eating food prepared away from home with poorer dietary quality and higher body mass index (BMI). In contrast, home meal preparation is associated with increased adherence to dietary guidelines, higher intake of fruits and vegetables, and overall better nutrition.
Rationale
Given the challenges of modern cooking practices, meal planning emerges as a potential strategy to promote healthier eating. By planning meals in advance, individuals may overcome barriers such as time constraints and lack of cooking skills, ultimately leading to increased home cooking and improved diet quality. However, there is limited scientific research on meal planning practices and their direct impact on dietary quality and weight status, particularly in the general population.
Study Objective
This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the relationship between meal planning and various dietary outcomes, including adherence to national nutritional guidelines, food variety, and weight status. The hypothesis was that meal planning encourages home meal preparation, leading to better dietary quality and reduced weight issues.
Methods
Study Population
The NutriNet-Santé study is an ongoing web-based prospective cohort study launched in France in May 2009, involving adult volunteers aged 18 and older. Participants complete annual self-administered questionnaires covering dietary intake, physical activity, and various lifestyle factors. The study has ethical approval and emphasizes informed consent.
Data Collection
1. Meal Planning Questionnaire:
   * Launched in April 2014, this optional questionnaire assessed participants' meal planning practices, including grocery shopping and cooking involvement.
   * Participants indicated their frequency of meal planning and the timing of their food choices (e.g., the day before, few days before).
   * Responses were categorized into “meal planners” and “non-meal planners.”
2. Socio-demographic and Economic Characteristics:
   * Data included sex, age, educational level, income, presence of children in the household, dieting history, and physical activity levels.
   * Monthly household income was calculated based on the French national methodology, considering consumption units.
3. Dietary Measurements:
   * Participants’ dietary intake was assessed through repeated 24-hour dietary records, capturing energy, macronutrients, and food group consumption.
   * A food variety score was calculated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire, and adherence to the French nutritional guidelines (mPNNS-GS) was estimated.
Results
1. Prevalence of Meal Planning:
   * A total of 57% of participants reported meal planning at least occasionally, indicating a significant portion of the population engages in this practice.
2. Diet Quality:
   * Meal planners had higher mPNNS-GS scores (Odds Ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.13, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [1.07–1.20]), suggesting better adherence to dietary guidelines.
   * They also exhibited a greater overall food variety (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.25, 95% CI: [1.18–1.32]).
3. Weight Status:
   * In women, meal planning was associated with significantly lower odds of being overweight (OR = 0.92 [0.87–0.98]) and obese (OR = 0.79 [0.73–0.86]).
   * In men, the association was significant only for obesity (OR = 0.81 [0.69–0.94]).
Dietary Measurements in the NutriNet-Santé Study
Overview of Dietary Assessment
Participants in the NutriNet-Santé study completed three non-consecutive 24-hour dietary records over a two-week period, capturing dietary intake on two weekdays and one weekend day. This design allowed researchers to analyze a comprehensive snapshot of participants' eating habits.
Data Collection Methods
1. 24-Hour Dietary Records:
   * Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed, estimating portion sizes using validated photographs, household measures, or exact quantities in grams or milliliters.
   * Daily mean food intakes were calculated, adjusted for the type of day (weekday or weekend).
   * Nutritional analysis utilized the NutriNet-Santé composition table, which includes over 2,000 food items.
2. Food Group Classification:
   * The study focused on various food groups essential for meal preparation and nutritional interest, including:
      * Fruits: Key for vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
      * Vegetables: Vital for overall health, promoting lower disease risk.
      * Fish and Seafood: Important sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
      * Meat and Eggs: Sources of protein and essential nutrients.

      * Added Fats: Includes oils and butters, essential for cooking.
      * Sugary Products: Evaluated for moderation in intake.
      * Starchy Foods: Includes potatoes and whole grains, key for carbohydrates and fiber.
Nutritional Guidelines Assessment
* PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS):
   * A 15-point validated score measuring adherence to French nutritional guidelines, consisting of 13 components related to food servings and moderation in consumption.
   * The modified PNNS-GS (mPNNS-GS) used in this analysis excluded the physical activity component, yielding a maximum score of 13.5.
Food Variety Assessment
* Food Variety Score:
   * Defined by the number of different food items consumed over the past year, assessed through a 240-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).
   * Participants reported consumption frequency based on typical portion sizes.
Anthropometric Data Collection
* Height and Weight Measurements:
   * Participants self-reported height and weight via an online questionnaire, allowing for BMI (Body Mass Index) calculations based on WHO classification standards.
Statistical Analysis
* Sample Selection:
   * Focused on participants who completed the meal planning questionnaire and reported involvement in meal preparation.
* Comparative Analysis:
   * Chi-square tests and Student's t-tests compared characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.
* Relationship Assessment:
   * ANCOVAs explored relationships between meal planning and dietary intake.
   * Logistic regression models assessed associations between meal planning and nutritional guidelines adherence, food variety scores, and BMI categories.
Results
Among 102,703 participants, 52,949 completed the meal planning questionnaire, with a final sample of 40,554 after excluding those not involved in meal preparation or lacking adequate dietary data. Meal planners demonstrated higher adherence to nutritional guidelines and reported better dietary quality, reflected in their mPNNS-GS and food variety scores.
Overview
The analysis provides a comprehensive examination of meal planning behaviors among individuals, contrasting the practices of meal planners and non-meal planners. It delves into their cooking frequency, decision-making processes, constraints faced, and dietary outcomes, utilizing a substantial dataset from the NutriNet-Santé study involving 40,554 participants.
Cooking Practices
1. Cooking Frequency:
* Meal Planners vs. Non-Meal Planners:
   * Meal planners cooked more frequently than non-meal planners.
   * The percentages of individuals cooking every day were as follows:
      * Non-Meal Planners: 28.79% cooked twice a day or more, and 34.70% cooked once a day.
      * Meal Planners: 33.60% cooked twice a day or more, and 37.06% cooked once a day.
   * A significant number of non-meal planners (7.14%) cooked once a week or less, whereas only 3.54% of meal planners did.
2. Timing of Meal Decision-Making:
* Meal planners typically decided what to cook in advance, with most making these decisions the day before or a few days prior. In contrast, non-meal planners primarily made decisions during the day or just before meals:
   * Non-Meal Planners:
      * 41.72% decided during the day.
      * 30.48% decided just before meals.
   * Meal Planners:
      * 26.27% decided during the day.
      * 11.87% decided just before meals.
* The ability to plan meals ahead was significantly less of a constraint for meal planners, as shown by their lower percentages of agreement on constraints (P < 0.0001).
3. Meal Planning Frequency and Duration:
* The majority of meal planners reported planning their meals several times a week (46.39%) or once a week (34.72%).
* Most meals were planned for a duration of a few days (79.05%), with only a small percentage planning meals for two weeks or more (1.18%).
* Meal planning was generally applicable to both weekdays and weekends (68.15%).
4. Sources of Inspiration:
* Participants drew inspiration primarily from:
   * Their personal recipe repertoire (41.15%).
   * Ingredients available during grocery shopping (56.32%).
   * Very few used digital resources like the internet or apps for meal planning (2.53%).
Nutritional Intake
1. Energy and Nutrient Intake Comparison:
* Overall, differences in energy and nutrient intakes between meal planners and non-meal planners were minimal.
* Energy intake was similar, with meal planners consuming 1865.01 kcal/day and non-meal planners 1867.11 kcal/day.
* Statistical significance was observed in certain nutrient intakes:
   * Proteins: Meal planners consumed slightly more protein (77.69 g/day) compared to non-meal planners (77.3 g/day) with a P-value of 0.038.
   * Carbohydrates: Meal planners had lower carbohydrate intake (191.98 g/day) than non-meal planners (193.23 g/day), with significance (P = 0.015).
   * Fruits and Vegetables: Meal planners consumed significantly more fruits (202.15 g/day) and vegetables (317.76 g/day) than non-meal planners, with P-values < 0.0001.
2. Food Variety and Adherence to Nutritional Guidelines:
* The multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that meal planners were significantly more likely to adhere to higher quartiles of the mPNNS-GS nutritional guidelines score.
* They also exhibited a greater variety in food choices, with higher scores in overall food variety, vegetable variety, and fruit variety compared to non-meal planners.
Weight Status Associations
1. Impact on Body Mass Index (BMI):
* Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that meal planning was associated with lower odds of being overweight or obese among women. For men, meal planning was linked to lower odds of being obese only:
   * In women:
      * The odds ratio (OR) for being overweight (BMI 25-30) was 0.91, indicating a significant association (P = 0.0005).
      * For obesity (BMI ≥30), the OR was 0.74 (P < 0.0001).
   * In men:
      * The OR for being overweight was 0.98 (P = 0.60) and for obesity, the OR was 0.78 (P = 0.0008).
Discussion and Public Health Implications
This study reveals that meal planning is positively correlated with improved dietary quality and variety, as well as a lower risk of overweight and obesity. Meal planners were observed to engage in more frequent cooking and strategic planning of meals, resulting in healthier dietary practices. Despite these associations, the researchers highlight the potential for reverse causality, where individuals with a healthier diet are more inclined to plan their meals.
Key Insights:
* The presence of children did not significantly alter meal planning practices among the sample, contrary to prior qualitative studies suggesting time scarcity in families may drive meal planning.
* Meal planning appears to be an effective strategy to improve dietary habits and could serve as a public health initiative to promote healthier eating patterns among the general population.
* Encouraging meal planning may require tailored resources to address perceived complexity and time constraints, as the study noted mixed perceptions about the practicality of meal planning among potential adopters.
Discussion
This study employs a large population-based sample to explore meal planning practices and their associations with dietary quality and weight status. Key findings indicate that meal planning correlates with better adherence to nutritional guidelines and greater food variety. Moreover, meal planning is linked to lower odds of being overweight and obese in women and obese in men.
Despite significant sociodemographic and lifestyle differences, meal planners and non-meal planners shared similar profiles. Notably, the presence of children in the household did not significantly affect meal planning behaviors, challenging previous studies suggesting that children create a sense of time scarcity, thus increasing the need for time-saving strategies like meal planning. However, fatigue and time constraints may hinder adherence to meal plans.
This research is among the first to provide a comprehensive view of meal planning within a general population. Over half of the participants reported planning their meals at least occasionally, with most planning meals several times a week for a few days, sourcing inspiration primarily from personal recipe collections and available ingredients. A prior survey of Canadians found that a significant portion planned their meals close to mealtime, highlighting the variability in meal planning modalities.
Data support the hypothesis that meal planning promotes adherence to nutritional guidelines and enhances food variety, particularly in fruits and vegetables. While energy and macronutrient intakes showed minimal differences, previous research indicates that pre-planning meals often leads to cooking homemade dishes, which is linked to improved diet quality. Hypotheses on how meal planning might encourage home food preparation include alleviating the uncertainty of meal choices, reducing time scarcity, preventing ingredient shortages, and enabling diverse recipe planning.
The study suggests that individuals valuing healthy eating are more likely to engage in meal planning, potentially creating reverse causality. Meal planners typically exhibit higher educational levels, income, and physical activity, correlating with healthier eating attitudes. Our findings revealed that women who plan meals are less likely to be overweight or obese, while the association in men was only significant for obesity.
From a public health perspective, promoting meal planning could enhance the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals. Previous studies indicate parental interest in learning meal planning techniques, yet some perceive it as complex and time-consuming. Identifying consumer needs is vital for developing sustainable meal planning tools. Our data demonstrate various approaches to meal planning, with ingredient availability during grocery shopping significantly influencing practices, highlighting the need for tools that assist with meal planning based on actual food supplies rather than preset menus.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths:
* Large Sample Size: The extensive participant base allows for the evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.
* Diverse Data Collection: A wide array of socio-economic and lifestyle variables helps control for confounding factors.
* Validity of Dietary Assessment: The web-based tool used for dietary records has demonstrated good validity in previous studies, while the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) captures dietary variety over longer periods.
Limitations:
* Cross-Sectional Design: The study’s design limits causal inferences, and results may not be generalizable beyond the sample.
* Self-Selection Bias: Participants may have higher health consciousness, impacting the representativeness of the findings.
* Variability in Dietary Repertoire: The FFQ data may not accurately reflect current dietary habits due to variations in timeframes.
* Potential Misreporting: Self-reported data may be subject to biases, though prior validation studies support the reliability of the collected data.
* Unaccounted Factors: Some mediating factors influencing the observed associations may not have been considered, although cooking frequency was included as a confounder.
Conclusions
The findings indicate that meal planners tend to exhibit better dietary quality, adhere more closely to nutritional guidelines, and experience increased food variety. Additionally, meal planning is associated with lower obesity rates in men and women, and lower overweight rates in women. While interventional or prospective studies are necessary to establish causality, the data underscore the potential benefits of promoting meal planning as a strategy to enhance dietary quality and prevent obesity. Future research should also explore the effectiveness and user adoption of meal planning applications designed to facilitate healthier eating practices.




Daily Physical Activity and its impact on diet
Source #1: How do popular dietary trends impact athletic performance?


Athlete Nutrition: Key Considerations
Athletes’ dietary intake should align with the demands of exercise, recovery, training adaptations, and overall health. This requires adequate calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fats), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), fiber, and fluids to optimize performance and prevent deficiencies.
1. Caloric Needs and Macronutrients
* Caloric Deficit Risks: Athletes in a caloric deficit or those not strength training may lose muscle mass or fail to gain muscle, negatively impacting performance. Prolonged caloric deficits also increase the risk of bone health issues, including bone mineral disease.
* Protein Intake: Protein needs for athletes exceed the general recommendation of 0.8 g/kg/day. For moderate-to-high-intensity exercise, athletes should aim for 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day, with regular consumption throughout the day and post-exercise to support muscle recovery and protein synthesis.
* Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are the preferred energy source for moderate to high-intensity exercise. Endurance athletes may require up to 10–12 g/kg/day to support training and recovery.
2. Micronutrients and Hydration
* Vitamins and Minerals: Essential vitamins and minerals play critical roles in energy metabolism (B-vitamins, magnesium), bone health (calcium, vitamin D), oxygen delivery (iron, folate, B12), and inflammation reduction (antioxidants, EPA/DHA).
* Hydration: Fluid needs vary, with general daily recommendations of 2.7–3.7 L/day. Athletes need individualized fluid assessments as sweat loss ≥2% can impair performance. Thirst is not always an accurate indicator of fluid requirements during exercise.
3. Popular Diets: Benefits and Limitations
* Low-Carbohydrate Diets: Generally not recommended for athletes due to the negative impact on glycogen levels, which are critical for performance. Carbohydrate-rich foods also provide essential nutrients that support energy metabolism, bone health, and antioxidant defenses.
* Intermittent Fasting: Can disrupt nutrient timing and reduce overall calorie intake, leading to energy deficits and potential performance impairments.
* Vegan/Vegetarian Diets: These diets may lack essential amino acids and micronutrients (iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D), which are crucial for athletes. While plant-based sources exist, their lower bioavailability requires careful planning to meet nutritional needs.
* Ketogenic Diets: These diets may increase intake of red meat and saturated fats, potentially elevating LDL cholesterol levels, which may affect long-term health.
4. Dietary Adjustments for Athletes
Gradual changes in diet, supported by behavioral strategies, can lead to sustained compliance and better long-term outcomes, especially in weight management. Incremental shifts in eating habits can help athletes adapt to new diets without compromising performance.

Article Summary: Applying Physical Activity Intervention Principles to Dietary Habits
Key Findings
* Informational interventions can be effective when combined with other approaches. While providing information about healthy eating can be helpful, it's often not sufficient on its own.
* Behavioral and social interventions are particularly effective in promoting dietary changes. This includes strategies like goal setting, self-monitoring, social support, and behavior modification techniques.
* Environmental and policy interventions can create supportive environments for healthy eating. This involves factors like food availability, accessibility, and affordability, as well as policies that promote healthy food choices.
Implications for Dietary Interventions
1. Combine multiple approaches: For optimal results, dietary interventions should incorporate a variety of strategies, including informational, behavioral, and environmental components.
2. Focus on behavior change: Rather than simply providing information about healthy eating, interventions should focus on helping individuals develop and maintain healthy eating behaviors.
3. Create supportive environments: Encourage healthy food choices by making healthy options more accessible, affordable, and appealing. This can involve working with grocery stores, restaurants, and policymakers to promote healthier food environments.
Specific Strategies for Dietary Interventions
* Goal setting: Help individuals set realistic and achievable goals for their dietary changes.
* Self-monitoring: Encourage individuals to track their food intake and physical activity to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
* Social support: Provide opportunities for individuals to connect with others who are also working on their dietary habits.
* Behavior modification techniques: Teach individuals how to identify and overcome barriers to healthy eating, such as emotional eating or cravings.
* Environmental interventions: Promote healthy food choices by making healthy options more available and affordable. This can involve working with schools, workplaces, and communities to create healthier food environments.
Additional Considerations
* Tailoring interventions: Interventions should be tailored to the individual needs and preferences of the participants.
* Addressing barriers: It's important to identify and address any barriers that individuals may face in adopting healthy eating habits.
* Long-term sustainability: Focus on creating sustainable changes that can be maintained over time.

The article delves deeply into how rapid globalization has reshaped people’s work, leisure, and behavior, which, in turn, has led to a significant rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, cancers, and mental disorders. These NCDs cause approximately 41 million deaths annually, accounting for a majority of global mortality. The multifactorial nature of these diseases makes lifestyle choices—particularly diet and exercise—central to both prevention and treatment. Diet and physical activity are modifiable factors with tremendous potential to influence health outcomes, yet the complex interactions between these behaviors are not sufficiently understood, largely due to the methodological difficulties involved in studying them comprehensively.
Key statistics illustrate the scale of the problem: 1.8 million deaths are attributed to excessive salt and sodium intake, over 1.5 million deaths to alcohol consumption, and around 830,000 to insufficient physical activity. Despite these established risk factors, the combined effects of diet and exercise on disease prevention remain under-researched, creating an urgent need for more targeted, synergistic interventions, which this Special Issue seeks to explore.
Early Life Interventions and the Importance of Habit Formation
Childhood and adolescence are highlighted as critical periods for establishing lifelong healthy habits. A nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and plant proteins, along with regular physical activity, is essential for proper growth and development. However, modern lifestyles, characterized by high consumption of processed foods and extended screen time, hinder the adoption of these habits. Large-scale studies have shown an association between low physical activity and unhealthy food consumption patterns in preschool children, adolescents, and beyond, significantly raising the risk for obesity and cardiovascular diseases later in life. For instance, studies cited in the article reveal that young children consuming sugary drinks and snacks in combination with low activity levels are more prone to developing obesity.
The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, is shown to be particularly beneficial when combined with higher physical fitness levels. Findings from the PASOS study reveal that a Mediterranean diet and increased fitness are linked to improved health-related quality of life (HRQL) among children, independent of body mass index (BMI). The research supports the idea that healthy lifestyle choices improve not just physical health but also social and mental well-being in young populations. Therefore, interventions targeting both diet and physical activity in childhood can yield long-term benefits across physical, mental, and social dimensions.
Adolescence, Early Adulthood, and the Onset of Risky Behaviors
Adolescence and early adulthood present additional challenges in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as peer pressure, increased autonomy, and hectic schedules often result in poor dietary habits and decreased physical activity. For example, studies show that the consumption of processed, unhealthy foods increases significantly during this period, while physical activity levels drop. This shift contributes to weight gain, obesity, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases later in life.
One notable study in this Special Issue investigates the combined effects of caloric restriction and rope-skipping exercise on young adults, demonstrating that while both caloric restriction and exercise reduced body weight and obesity, only the combination of the two reduced inflammation markers and improved the metabolic profile. This suggests that diet and exercise interventions are more effective when implemented together, particularly in reducing cardiovascular disease risk. The challenge, however, lies in maintaining caloric restriction over long periods, as adherence tends to decline.
Aging, Multimorbidity, and the Role of Physical Activity
In older adults, aging often brings physiological changes that increase the risk of diseases and disability. The prevalence of conditions like metabolic syndrome—marked by abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, and abnormal lipid levels—rises with age, contributing to the growing burden of multimorbidity. Two studies in the Special Issue provide insights into the role of physical activity in mitigating the effects of metabolic syndrome. For instance, one study highlights that while 30–40% of older adults may develop metabolic syndrome, those who remain physically active have a lower prevalence of abdominal obesity and hypertension, indicating that physical activity can slow the progression of the disease.
Older adults also experience a loss of healthy lifestyle patterns, which further exacerbates health risks. The importance of maintaining these patterns in old age is demonstrated through studies showing that older adults adhering to the Mediterranean diet and engaging in regular physical activity report higher HRQL and physical self-concept. This is crucial because, as people age, maintaining physical and mental health becomes increasingly difficult, yet these lifestyle habits remain potent in promoting health and reducing the risk of falls, disability, and frailty.
Polypharmacy and the Role of Fitness in Reducing Drug Dependence
Older populations are often burdened by polypharmacy, the concurrent use of multiple medications due to the presence of multiple chronic conditions. A study in this Special Issue investigates the relationship between obesity, physical fitness, and drug consumption in older adults. The findings suggest that fitter individuals with lower fat mass take fewer medications, highlighting that maintaining a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise not only improves overall health but also reduces reliance on pharmaceutical interventions. This has broader implications for healthcare systems, as reduced drug dependence in older populations could alleviate pressures on public health services.
Diet, Exercise, and the Risk of Cancer
One study focuses on the interaction between coffee consumption, physical activity, and cancer risk. Coffee, due to its bioactive compounds, has been associated with reduced risks for several cancers. However, a peculiar finding showed that individuals engaging in higher levels of physical activity and consuming coffee had an increased risk for certain cancers, underscoring the complexity of the relationship between lifestyle factors and disease prevention. This suggests that the timing and intensity of lifestyle interventions may influence cancer risk differently across individuals, necessitating more research into the precise mechanisms at play.
At the same time, the article discusses the growing body of evidence supporting the independent benefits of exercise in cancer prevention and recovery. Exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of various cancers, improve recovery outcomes, and enhance quality of life for cancer patients. The potential synergy between diet and exercise in preventing and treating cancers remains a topic requiring further exploration, as preliminary data from the study suggest positive interactions between coffee consumption, physical activity, and reduced risk of thyroid cancer.
Future Directions and Individualized Health Interventions
The Special Issue concludes by emphasizing that while significant progress has been made in understanding the roles of diet and exercise in health, much remains to be explored, particularly regarding their interaction. The complexity of isolating single dietary components or nutrients makes it challenging to fully comprehend how diet and physical activity interact to influence health outcomes. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that combining these factors can maximize health benefits across a wide range of conditions, from cardiovascular diseases to cancer and mental health disorders.
There is a strong call for more individualized and precise interventions that account for personal lifestyle patterns, as this approach could improve adherence and maximize the beneficial effects of both diet and exercise. This Special Issue underscores the necessity for continued research that explores how these modifiable lifestyle factors interact across different populations, age groups, and diseases.










Budget for food

Introduction
* The Food Nutrition Service (FNS) under the USDA, administers the Food Stamp Program (FSP), focusing on promoting balanced, healthful diets.
* To improve FSP participants’ diets, educators need insights into:
   * How households allocate food resources.
   * How food dollars are distributed across key food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, protein).
* The USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) developed the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) as a national standard for affordable food baskets for low-income households.
   * TFP estimates food costs based on national average prices for at-home consumption, adjusted annually for inflation.
   * TFP costs are scaled based on household size and adjusted for inflation.
* Research shows that many low-income households spend enough to meet the TFP food basket but also allocate funds to more expensive, less nutritious food-away-from-home (FAFH).
* This study examines:
   * How closely low-income households match their at-home food budgets to TFP guidelines.
   * How food dollars are allocated across food groups: cereal/bakery, meat/poultry/fish/eggs, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.
   * How changes in income affect food spending for low-income households compared to higher-income households.
Methodology
* Data Sources:
   * 2002 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) data, reporting household food expenditures over two weeks.
   * CNPP data on TFP food cost estimates adjusted for age, gender, and household size.
* Food Spending Categories:
   * At-home foods: Groceries bought at stores, food prepared during trips.
   * Away-from-home foods (FAFH): Meals from restaurants, fast food, vending machines, and school lunches.
* Calculation:
   * The study calculates the ratio of actual household food spending to the TFP-estimated cost for:
      * Total at-home food.
      * Specific food groups: cereal/bakery, meat/poultry/fish/eggs, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.
* Key Objectives:
   * Assess whether low-income households allocate enough of their food budget to meet TFP standards.
   * Identify which food groups are underfunded or overfunded.
   * Examine how income influences food spending, especially on at-home versus away-from-home food.
* Analysis:
   * Compare food budget allocation across low-income and higher-income households.
   * Identify patterns where low-income households might deviate from TFP guidelines due to budget constraints or other factors.
Food Security vs. Budget Allocation:
* The analysis focuses on budget allocation, not food security. A gap between spending and the TFP doesn't indicate food scarcity, just a different allocation than the TFP suggests.
* Average low-income household spends 1.28 times the TFP cost on total food (at home + away), but the median household matches the TFP cost almost exactly (ratio = 0.99).
Spending on Food Away from Home (FAFH):
* Low-income households spend about 27% of total food dollars on FAFH, representing potential deviations from a nutritious, low-cost diet.
* FAFH is usually more expensive and less nutritious than food at home.
* After accounting for FAFH, low-income households only spend 86% of the TFP on at-home food.
Spending Differences in Households with Children:
* Couples with children spend only 73% of the TFP on food at home, while female-headed households spend 82%.
* Free food from pantries or school lunches may offset some of these differences.
Budget Allocation Across Food Groups:
* The TFP allocates 92% of its cost to four main food groups (cereal/bakery, meat/poultry/fish/eggs, dairy, fruits/vegetables), but low-income households only allocate 71% of their at-home food budget to these groups.
* Low-income households spend 12% of their at-home food budget on miscellaneous prepared foods and 9% on non-alcoholic beverages.
* Fats, oils, sugars, and sweets make up another 8% of their budget.
Under-Allocated Food Groups:
* Fruits and vegetables are the most under-allocated food group, followed by dairy, and then meat, poultry, fish, and eggs.
* Nutrition educators could focus on increasing spending on fruits/vegetables and promoting healthy diets.
* Suggestions include color-coded food stamps that allocate a fixed proportion to fruits and vegetables.
Time and Cooking Skills Impact:
* Low-income households may allocate a significant share of their budget to prepared foods and FAFH due to time constraints and lack of cooking skills.
* A revised TFP including prepared foods may be necessary, but would require an increase in food stamp allotments to cover the higher costs.
Conclusions:
* Although low-income households spend roughly the same as the TFP cost on total food, they don't allocate their food dollars in line with the TFP.
* Households with women and children tend to deviate the most from the TFP, supporting the FNS proposal to target these households for special nutritional education.
* Further research is needed to examine what specific foods these households acquire, including free foods.

Strategies for Eating Well on a Budget
________________


Introduction:
Many people believe that healthy eating is expensive, particularly when comparing specific items such as organic versus conventional produce, or shopping carts filled with fresh produce, poultry, and fish compared to processed foods like boxed macaroni and cheese. While it is true that processed, unhealthy foods often appear cheaper, creating nutritious meals doesn't have to break the bank. In fact, a meta-analysis revealed that healthier dietary patterns cost only $1.48 more per day compared to less healthful ones.
________________


Food Affordability and Government Resources
For individuals struggling to afford food in the U.S., there are federal food assistance programs available to citizens and legal non-citizens who meet specific income and nutritional guidelines. In addition, local food pantries are widely accessible, offering basic foods and beverages.
________________


Supermarket Shopping Strategies
________________


Healthy eating on a budget begins at the supermarket. While finding sale items is helpful, equally important is avoiding unnecessary purchases driven by impulse or hunger. Additionally, food waste significantly contributes to overspending when fresh items spoil before being used. Below are strategies to maximize savings while maintaining a nutritious diet:
1. Meal Planning:
Plan meals for the upcoming week and craft a shopping list focused on the required ingredients. This helps avoid overbuying or impulse purchases.
2. Consider Meatless Meals:
Plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils, tofu, and whole grains are often more affordable than meat or fish. Incorporating these into meals can save money and increase nutritional value. For those who enjoy meat, consider using smaller portions as flavor enhancers while focusing on plant-based ingredients.
3. Purchase Filling Foods:
Prioritize nutrient-dense foods that are filling. A 3-pound bag of apples may cost $4.00 compared to a large $2.50 bag of chips, but the apples will keep you fuller longer. Research indicates that unsatiating foods lead to more frequent eating, which may increase food costs over time.
4. Don’t Shop on an Empty Stomach:
Shopping while hungry can lead to impulsive purchases of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. Eating a piece of fruit or some nuts before grocery shopping can prevent this.
5. Be Flexible with Your Shopping List:
Sales on items like fresh produce, poultry, and fish are opportunities to save. Purchasing extra when prices are low and freezing items for later use is a great way to avoid future price fluctuations. Many fresh items, including bananas, berries, avocados, broccoli, and fish, freeze well.
6. Buy Staple Foods in Bulk:
Bulk buying may seem expensive initially but reduces long-term costs. Staple foods like grains, legumes, and dried beans can be stored for long periods and are generally cheaper per unit. For instance, a 1-pound bag of brown rice may cost $1.59, while a 5-pound bag costs $3.99, bringing the per-pound cost down to about $0.80. Calculating the cost per unit for different package sizes can help you make more economical choices.
7. Buy Generic or Store Brands:
Many generic brands contain the same ingredients as more expensive brand-name products but at a lower cost. The price difference is often due to advertising and packaging rather than product quality.
8. Check Discounted Produce Sections:
Many grocery stores have a section for produce that is about to expire but is still perfectly edible. These items are heavily discounted and can be consumed immediately or frozen for future use.
9. Avoid Overbuying Perishables:
Purchasing more fresh produce than you can consume in a week can lead to food waste. Items like salad greens, mushrooms, and berries spoil quickly, so plan to eat them within their shelf life or freeze them for later.
10. Proper Food Storage:
Learning how to store produce correctly can extend its shelf life. For example, herbs like cilantro can last longer if stored in a cup of water covered with a bag. Ginger, garlic, and onions also have longer shelf lives but can be frozen for extended use.
11. Regrow Fresh Produce:
Certain items like green onions can be regrown at home. Place the white root ends of green onions in a cup of water on a sunny windowsill, and they will regrow. Snip what you need and let the rest grow for later use.
________________


Nutritious and Affordable Staples
________________


A healthy diet doesn’t have to rely on expensive, fresh ingredients. Processed foods, while often viewed negatively, can still play a role in a nutritious diet, depending on the degree of processing and the ingredients added. For example, frozen vegetables and canned foods without added salt or sugar can be cost-effective, long-lasting options.
Here are affordable staples that are nutrient-dense and available year-round:
   * Proteins: Canned beans, lentils, eggs, and canned fish like tuna or salmon are inexpensive and protein-rich.
   * Produce: Fresh produce that stores well, such as sweet potatoes, carrots, and cabbage, as well as frozen or canned vegetables like spinach, peas, and tomatoes, offer essential vitamins and minerals while being affordable year-round.
   * Whole Grains and Pastas: Items like brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and oats are inexpensive, provide long-lasting energy, and offer important nutrients such as fiber.
   * Snacks: Healthier snacks like unsalted nuts, popcorn kernels, or dried fruits (with no added sugar) are more filling than processed snack foods like chips, ultimately helping to reduce overall food costs by reducing unnecessary consumption.
   * Low-Sodium Seasonings: Spices like garlic powder, onion powder, and dried herbs, as well as low-sodium broth and canned tomatoes, can enhance the flavor of meals without adding unhealthy amounts of salt or processed seasonings.
________________


Maximizing Kitchen Efficiency
________________


Once you’ve stocked your kitchen with nutritious staples, it’s time to transform them into affordable and healthful meals. Here are a few recipe ideas that cost $2 or less per serving:
   1. Veggie Burgers:
   * Mash a can of black beans with cooked sweet potato, oats, and carrots.
   * Form the mixture into patties and cook them on the stove for 3 minutes per side.
   * Serve on whole grain buns or over greens for a nutritious and filling meal.
   2. Homemade Chicken Nuggets:
   * Coat chicken pieces in plain yogurt and crushed cornflakes before baking them in the oven.
   * This healthier alternative to fried chicken nuggets uses simple, inexpensive ingredients like yogurt and cornflakes, with the option to add herbs for extra flavor.
   3. Three-Bean Chili:
   * Combine canned black beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans with diced tomatoes, spices, and onions for a protein-rich chili.
   * Serve with brown rice or enjoy on its own for a meal that is both filling and affordable.
________________


Mindful Eating for Budgeting
Mindful eating, or eating attentively and slowly, can help individuals feel satisfied with smaller portions. This practice not only increases the enjoyment of food but also helps reduce overall food consumption, preventing overeating and saving money. Conversely, distracted eating—such as eating in front of the television—can lead to overconsumption and hunger soon after eating, increasing the likelihood of higher food costs.
________________


Conclusion
Healthy eating on a budget requires thoughtful planning and strategic shopping. By focusing on cost-effective staple foods, shopping sales, avoiding impulse purchases, and properly storing foods to reduce waste, it is possible to maintain a nutritious diet without overspending. Additionally, government assistance programs and local food pantries are valuable resources for those struggling with food insecurity.

How to Reduce Your Grocery Bill to $50 a Week While Maintaining Nutrition
________________


Overview
Many people find it challenging to balance a tight grocery budget with the need to fuel their workouts and maintain healthy eating habits. With expenses adding up, it’s important to be a smarter shopper, focusing on nutrition and efficiency. This guide outlines steps to cut your grocery bill in half, from $100 to $50 per week, without sacrificing essential nutrients.
________________


1. Set a Strict Budget
   * Create a Food Budget: Set a weekly grocery budget of $50. Allocate this amount to essentials like protein, carbs, and fats.
   * Reap the Savings: Reducing your weekly bill by $50 could lead to $200 in monthly savings, which you can divert toward other expenses or savings.
________________


2. Cut Down on Waste
   * Inventory Check: Take stock of what you already have before buying more groceries. Many people overlook pantry items like frozen vegetables, canned goods, and condiments.
   * Embrace Leftovers: Repurpose last night’s dinner as today’s lunch. Freeze leftovers for future meals. Reducing food waste is essential—on average, Americans throw away 20 pounds of food monthly, worth $28–$43.
________________


3. Use Coupons
   * Smart Couponing: Use coupons, but focus on essentials rather than falling into the trap of buying unnecessary items just for a discount. Check local newspapers, coupon books, online resources, and grocery store circulars.
   * Generic Brands: Opt for store brands, which often contain the same ingredients as name-brand products but at a lower price.
________________


4. Protein Cost-Saving Strategies
   * Affordable Protein Sources: Meat can drain your budget quickly. Instead of fresh cuts of beef, chicken, or salmon, opt for canned tuna, chicken, or salmon, which are cheaper and equally nutritious.
   * Plant-Based Alternatives: Canned beans, lentils, quinoa, and tofu provide cost-effective protein alternatives.
________________


5. Meal Planning
   * Menu Planning: Plan meals for the week to save money and time. Focus on meals that are balanced with protein, carbs, and fats to meet your macronutrient needs. Meal prep helps streamline cooking and ensures you stick to your budget.

Healthy Meal Planning on a Budget: 15 Tips from a Nutrition Therapist
________________


Overview
Healthy eating doesn't have to break the bank. Meal planning ensures nutritious meals while limiting waste and overspending. Rebecca Beaudoin, RDN, LMNT, shares 15 practical tips to help you stick to your budget while eating healthily.
________________


1. Plan for Leftovers
   * Double Your Portions: Cook more than needed for dinner and use the leftovers for lunch the next day. This saves both time and money.
________________


2. Batch Cooking
   * Cook and Freeze: Make large portions and freeze meals for later. This works well with most dishes, except cream-based meals and leafy greens.
________________


3. Buy Discounted Meat
   * Shop Smart: Buy meat when it's on sale and freeze it in portioned sizes. Freezing ensures meat stays fresh longer and reduces waste.
________________


4. Choose Low-Cost Fruits
   * Budget-Friendly Fruits: Stick to affordable, versatile fruits like bananas, oranges, and apples, which are great for snacks and last longer.
________________


5. Opt for Canned Veggies
   * Affordable and Convenient: Canned vegetables are inexpensive and easy to store. Choose options labeled "no salt added" or "low sodium" for a healthier choice.
________________


6. Stock Up on Potatoes and Onions
   * Staple Ingredients: Potatoes and onions are cheap, long-lasting, and versatile, adding flavor and fiber to meals.
________________


7. Compare Produce Prices
   * Walk the Whole Section: Walk through the entire produce aisle to compare prices and find the best deals, as sale items are often hidden in the back.
________________


8. Choose In-Season Produce
   * Seasonal Savings: Produce in season is typically cheaper and fresher. Check a seasonal produce list for the best deals each month.
________________


9. Buy Frozen Produce
   * Long-Lasting and Affordable: Frozen fruits and vegetables are often cheaper than fresh, especially for out-of-season items. They maintain their nutritional value and last longer.
________________


10. Order Curbside or Delivery
   * Avoid Impulse Buys: Ordering groceries online helps avoid unnecessary purchases and ensures you stick to your plan. Use the extra time saved to prep meals.
________________


11. Stock Up on Pantry Staples
   * Budget Pantry Essentials: Keep your pantry stocked with basics like brown rice, lentils, beans, oatmeal, and canned tomatoes. These items allow you to quickly assemble meals without breaking the bank.
________________


12. Use a Cashback Credit Card
   * Earn While You Spend: A cashback credit card can help you save even more, especially if it offers points or cashback on grocery purchases.
________________


13. Opt for Canned Tuna and Salmon
   * Affordable Protein: Canned tuna and salmon are cheaper alternatives to fresh fish and are equally nutritious. Rinse them to reduce sodium.
________________


14. Shop Once a Week
   * Minimize Shopping Trips: Fewer trips to the store reduce impulse buys. Plan shopping around weekly sales for extra savings.
________________


15. Consider Prepared Foods in a Pinch
   * Grocery Store Options: When meal planning isn’t possible, opt for healthier prepared foods from the grocery store, such as salads or soups. These options are often cheaper and healthier than fast food.

Accessibility of food (availability in local stores, seasonal options)
Source #1: https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/26/4/634/2467263
Introduction
   * Importance of Dietary Quality:
   * Unhealthy diets increase the risk of overweight, obesity, and chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.
   * Dietary habits are influenced by a variety of individual, social, and environmental factors.
   * Role of the Environment:
   * Healthy dietary changes are more likely when the environment supports healthful food options.
   * There's growing interest in understanding how the food environment impacts food selection and dietary quality.
   * Definition of Food Environment:
   * The food environment includes everything around individuals that affects their food choices and eating habits.
   * Local retail food environments determine the availability of healthy, nutritious food.
   * Access to Supermarkets vs. Convenience Stores (CS):
   * Better access to supermarkets and limited access to CS has been associated with healthier diets.
   * CS are small stores with mostly ready-to-eat, energy-dense foods, and limited fresh options, potentially encouraging unhealthy eating patterns.
   * Inconsistent Findings on CS and Diet:
   * The association between CS presence and eating patterns has produced inconsistent results across studies.
   * Variability may be due to differences in population density, urban planning, and infrastructure across study areas.
   * Most research has focused on small geographic areas (rural or urban) and has been conducted in the USA and UK.
   * Research Limitations:
   * Previous research often focused on individual dietary components like fruit and vegetable intake, rather than overall diet quality.
   * A more comprehensive score that measures multiple aspects of the diet could provide better insight into dietary healthiness.
   * Study Aim:
   * The article aims to investigate the association between the accessibility of local CS and overall dietary habits in a large Danish adult population across 
   * metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.


Results and Discussion
Association Between Convenience Stores (CS) and Unhealthy Diet:
   * Presence of CS within 500 meters from home was linked to unhealthy diets in non-metropolitan areas.
   * No significant association was found in metropolitan areas.
   * Odds of an unhealthy diet increased with more CS in the neighborhood.
Between-Municipality Variance:
   * Differences in unhealthy diets across municipalities were largely explained by CS density and individual characteristics.
   * High socioeconomic status (SES) clustering in certain neighborhoods contributed to variance.
   * When individual SES factors were considered, area-level SES had no significant effect on diet.
Previous Research & Methodological Variability:
   * Few studies have examined CS accessibility and diet; results are inconsistent due to varying methods (e.g., different measures of density or proximity).
   * This study used a 500 m network buffer zone to measure CS density, reflecting actual walking distance.
Diet Quality Score (DQS):
   * The study used DQS to measure overall dietary intake, which is a better predictor of health and disease risk than individual food items.
   * DQS is linked to healthier diets with higher nutrient intake and lower saturated fats.
   * Diet was self-reported, which may introduce non-differential misclassification and underestimations.
Strengths of the Study:
   * Use of high-quality Danish registers for residence and CS locations.
   * The study used individual-level exposure data to minimize aggregation error.
   * Multilevel logistic regression was used to account for the clustering of individuals with similar characteristics in the same areas.
Findings in Metropolitan Areas:
   * No association between CS density within 250 m and dietary patterns in the metropolitan area of Copenhagen.
   * High availability of food stores in the area might overshadow the influence of CS on diet.
Limitations:
   * Did not examine other types of food stores like grocery stores, supermarkets, or restaurants.
   * Cross-sectional design limits the ability to establish causal relationships between CS and diet.
   * Market forces may drive CS placement based on local demand.
Conclusion:
   * CS accessibility is significantly associated with unhealthy dietary habits, particularly in non-metropolitan areas.
   * Results highlight the importance of local context and area composition in food environment studies.
   * Future research is needed to explore the complete food environment and develop better measures of accessibility and impact.

Results
General Findings:
   * Moderate evidence supports the idea that neighborhood food environments influence dietary health.
   * There is a lack of reproducibility across studies due to the absence of a standard method for measuring local food access.
Perceived vs. GIS-Based Measures:
   * Perceived availability of food stores is consistently related to healthy dietary outcomes.
   * GIS-based accessibility (distance to stores) showed little correlation with dietary outcomes.
   * GIS-based availability measures (store presence and density) showed mixed results.
   * Survey-based perceived accessibility measures were weak and inconsistent.
Unexpected Findings:
   * Some studies found higher fruit and vegetable costs were linked to higher consumption, possibly due to better quality produce in more expensive stores.
   * Perceived affordability measures produced mixed results, possibly due to under-reporting by people who buy little produce.
Variability in Dietary Outcomes:
   * Outcomes varied widely, but fruit and vegetable intake was the most commonly studied.
   * Evidence for associations between fast food outlets and consumption was weak, potentially due to the ubiquity of fast food or individual preferences governing fast food consumption.
Non-US Food Environments:
   * Patterns of food deserts may differ in countries outside the US, Australia, and New Zealand due to different economic segregation histories.
   * Few studies from outside the US and Australia/New Zealand were included in this review, limiting comparisons.
Publication Bias:
   * Studies showing positive relationships between food environments and dietary outcomes are more likely to be published.
   * Most studies in the review showed at least one significant positive relationship, but publication bias may affect the true picture.
Comparison of Methods:
   * GIS-based studies were more common but less consistent in revealing significant relationships between food environments and dietary outcomes.
   * GIS measures fail to capture non-geographic dimensions of access like food affordability, choice, or store accommodation.
   * Geographic boundaries imposed by GIS may not align with what residents consider their neighborhood.
   * Secondary source data used in GIS-based measures may be inaccurate.

Title
Recent Evidence on the Effects of Food Store Access on Food Choice and Diet Quality
Definition
The article examines how access to food stores, particularly supermarkets, influences food choices and overall diet quality among U.S. households.
Importance
Understanding the relationship between food store access and dietary choices is critical for developing effective public health policies and interventions aimed at improving nutrition, especially in underserved communities.
Challenges
   * Limited impact of store proximity on food choices.
   * Complex interaction of various factors (household resources, education, preferences) in determining diet quality.
   * Mixed results in studies regarding the correlation between supermarket access and dietary improvements.
Key Findings
   1. Limited Influence of Proximity: Access to supermarkets does not guarantee better food choices; other factors play a significant role.
   2. Consumer Behavior: Households often bypass the nearest store for better options, indicating that store characteristics (e.g., quality, price) matter more than distance.
   3. Diet Quality Impact: Limited access results in modest decreases in the purchase of healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, with some increase in unhealthy options.
   4. Food Prices Over Access: Price sensitivity significantly influences food purchasing decisions, often more than store access.
Recommendations
   * Financial Incentives: Programs like subsidies for fruits and vegetables can encourage healthier choices among low-income consumers.
   * Consumer Education: In-store campaigns can enhance awareness and guide healthier purchasing behavior.
   * Transportation Solutions: Improving access to multiple stores through better transport options may be more effective than just building new supermarkets.
Conclusion
Improving access to healthy food options alone is insufficient for enhancing diet quality. A comprehensive approach addressing pricing, education, and consumer preferences is crucial for effective dietary improvements and public health outcomes.
